For Shiv Sena, the act of one of its MPs thrashing a 60-year-old Air India employee with a slipper is not as big an incident as it is being projected. The party has come out in full defence of Osmanabad MP Ravindra Gaikwad.Speaking in Lok Sabha, Shiv Sena MP from Amravati Anandrao Adsul compared Gaikwad's act withan in-flight incident involving TV show host Kapil Sharma."Even Kapil Sharma misbehaved on flight after getting drunk but no ban imposed on him," Adsul said raising the issue of airlines refusing to fly Gaikwad following the last week's incident.AVIATION MINISTER RESPONDS"Rules are the same for everyone. We have good safety regulations but never in my dreams expected a Parliament member to be involved in such an incident," Civil Aviation Minister Ashok Gajapati Raju said in response to Adsul's remark. "Violence of any kind can be a disaster for airlines," Raju said. GAIKWAD GOES INTO HIDING, SAYS WILL APPEAR IN PARLIAMENT ON WEDNESDAYThreatening legal action against Air India, a defiant Gaikwad said he would take legal action against Air India for refusing to fly him. The national carrier had on last Friday cancelled his return ticket from Delhi to Pune. "A senior Sena leader ordered me not to speak with media till Wednesday (March 29) and so I am not coming before the media. I will come to Omerga on Tuesday and celebrate Marathi new year Gudi Padwa with my family and Shiv Sainiks. I will then attend Lok Sabha session (in New Delhi) on Wednesday," Gaikwad said.The Osmanabad MP, however, refused to reveal his whereabouts.Exclusive: Defiant Shiv Sena MP Ravindra Gaikwad dares Air India to blacklist himALSO READ: Shiv Sena backs Ravindra Gaikwad, calls bandh in support of MP in Osmanabad
DMK working president MK Stalin has alleged that the ruling AIADMK government has not shown any interest in the ongoing farmers' strike at the Jantar Mantar Delhi. Tamil Nadu farmers are protesting at the Jantar Mantar in the national capital from the last two weeks seeking drought-relief package. They also want the Centre to waive off the farmer loans.The farmers of Tamil Nadu had a rough season in 2016 and neighboring state Karnataka refused to share Cauvery river water even against the Supreme Court's orders. With less or no income, farmers' suicide increased and members of the farmers association went to Delhi to meet the concerned ministers with their plea. TWO WEEKS ON, PALANISWAMI SILENT ON FARMERS' ISSUEIt has been almost two weeks that the farmers are protesting at Jantar Manta but the state government led by Palanisamy has not yet reacted on the issue. It appears that they are worried more about the RK Nagar bypolls as the party's deputy general secretary TTV Dinakaran is contesting from the constituency.Irked by the state government's attitude, Stalin said, "The state government is worried more on how to distribute money to gain votes for the RK Nagar polls than about the farmers' protest in Delhi."The DMK leader also claimed that during the budget session he had requested the 'benami' government to waive off the farmer loans citing that more than 200 farmers have died so far "but the government, running on the advise of a convict, didn't care much".UP, PUNJAB FARMERS EXTENDED SUPPORT"Farmers of Uttar Pradesh, Punjab and Haryana have extended their support for Tamil farmers and met them. Even BJP minister from the state Pon Radhakrishnan met the farmers but our chief minister is least bothered. He is only concerned about segregating votes for a Foreign Exchange Regulation Act (FERA) convict in RK Nagar," Stalin said.Many even questioned how the ministers of the state had time to stay in Delhi to attain the twin leaf symbol but couldn't take time out to meet the farmers.

In the run up to Delhi's municipal corporation elections, Aam Aadmi Party MLA Ved Prakash Satish has quit the party to join the BJP. Ved Prakash Satish represented Bawana in the Delhi Assembly after securing a big win the 2015 polls with a margin of over 50,000 votes.Ved Prakash joined the BJP in presence of Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari and party MLA Vijender Gupta. Manoj Tiwari tweeted the photograph of Ved Prakash joining the BJP and his resignation letter.Quitting AAP, Ved Prakash Satish said that the country is 'undergoing a change'. Ved Prakash said, "A big change is taking place in the country. Prime Minister Modi has come at the forefront as a yogi (ascetic) and Yogi (Adityanath) has come in Uttar Pradesh. I have come here (in the BJP's fold) to become part of that change."Delhi BJP president Manoj Tiwari said, "The opposition is getting frustrated seeing the rise of BJP, which is why they are making false accusations." 'KEJRIWAL IS NOT GETTING RIGHT INFORMATION'Ved Prakash also said that Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal is surrounded by people who are giving him wrong information, which is slowing down progress. Ved Prakash Satish accused Arvind Kejriwal government of doing 'nothing for improvement in Shahabad Dairy region', which falls under his Assembly constituency of Bawana. He said, "The Delhi government did not do anything for Shahabad Dairy region. Nothing was done in Shahabad Dairy in the last two years. Even a crematorium was not built there.""School building was not built. I tried several times. But, no one listened to me," Ved Prakash said.'NO ONE LISTENS IN AAP'Ved Prakash Satish accused Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia of not addressing the concerns of the people. Ved Prakash said, "A five-year-old girl was raped in my area. I called up Manish Sisodia. I messaged him. But, he did not pick up my phone for three days.""The minister does not pick up phone calls from an MLA," Ved Prakash complained.Ved Prakash Satish is the vice-chairman of Delhi Khadi Gramodyog and also the chairman of District Development Committee."I had not come here to become an MLA. I went there thinking that something new was going to happen. I don't have lust for an MLA's position. This is why I tendered my resignation," Ved Prakash said.
As India and other countries await an automatic exchange of information from next year about suspected black money hoarders in Swiss banks, Switzerland has said it can suspend such sharing of details at any time if confidentiality is not maintained. As part of an international commitment to fight the black money menace, Switzerland has effected the automatic exchange of information standard since January 1, 2017. The sharing of details under this framework will begin from next year with the first batch of countries, including India. "Domestic financial institutions are collecting this data for the first time this year, and the Swiss tax authorities will exchange it with their counterparts in partner states in 2018," said the State Secretariat for International Financial Matters (SIF). The Swiss agency is mandated to defend the interests of Switzerland on international financial and tax matters and participates in international negotiations. It said in its latest quarterly newsletter that necessary steps will be in place to ensure the exchanged data do not fall into the wrong hands or get misused. "Switzerland is prepared in principle to introduce the automatic exchange of information with all states and territories which meet the relevant requirements. In this sense, the confidentiality and security of the data are important elements of this international standard," it said. "Switzerland implements the automatic reciprocal exchange of information only with countries which can guarantee confidentiality and data protection. Before any exchanges occur, the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes carries out a thorough examination as to whether or not the partner states which have undertaken to introduce the automatic exchange of information comply with the requirements." "In some important cases, Switzerland additionally gets an on-the-spot impression of the situation in the partner states. Given that Switzerland does not belong to the group of countries which implemented the standard early on (so-called early adopters), it is also benefiting from the experience of other countries," the SIF said. "Before the first exchange occurs, it will be able to examine if all significant elements of the standard have been met. Should it subsequently transpire that a country has not fulfilled its obligations, Switzerland can at any time suspend the automatic exchange of information with the country concerned," it added.SYSTEM IN PLACE 'RELATIVELY SIMPLE' The Swiss agency further said the system in place so far has been "relatively simple", wherein whenever a foreign tax authority was interested in obtaining information located in Switzerland, it had to make a request for administrative assistance. "However, the rapid international developments in recent years have provided Switzerland with two new forms of exchange of information in the area of taxes: spontaneous and automatic exchange of information (AEOI)," it added. In the case of the AEOI, countries mutually exchange information automatically on financial accounts and the details in this case are determined as the standards drawn up by the OECD. The information in spontaneous exchange needs to be exchanged if the transmitting country suspects that the information available might be of interest to another country. While spontaneous exchange has nothing to do with voluntary in this context -- it only means that no preliminary request has been submitted -- this framework was being handled very differently from country to country up to now, the SIF said. "Within the scope of the OECD and G20 project to combat base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS), the spontaneous exchange of information was specified for the first time in the area of advance tax rulings, where there is a risk of base erosion or profit shifting." "The Federal Council adopted the current international standard in this area in the context of a revision of the Tax Administrative Assistance Ordinance. Switzerland will spontaneously exchange information on advance tax rulings for the first time next year," it added. 'NUMBER OF DOMESTIC SWISS BANK BRANCHES HAS HALVED' The agency further said that over the past 30 years, the number of domestic bank branches in Switzerland has almost halved. "A reduction in the number of banking institutions and their branches can be the result of mergers, acquisitions and bankruptcies. A number of policy measures have been put in place by Swiss authorities in recent years to address concerns of its banks providing high secrecy walls around their global clients. New rules make it much easier for several foreign jurisdictions, including India, to get details from Switzerland about people suspected to be involved in tax evasion and other financial crimes. Switzerland has also been issuing notices to several resident Indians and even Indians settled abroad after the receipt of request from India for "administrative assistance", including information about their Swiss bank account details. As per the local law, Switzerland gives an opportunity to the entity concerned to challenge the sharing of information, before providing the assistance to the requesting nation. While India and Switzerland late last year signed a new pact for automatic exchange of information about account details 2018 onwards, the pending requests have been made under their existing bilateral tax treaty. The pace of seeking such details seems to have quickened in recent months, going by the sudden spurt in the number of Indian names figuring in such notifications.

BT has been fined ?2m, the largest penalty imposed by regulator Ofcom, and will have to pay an estimated ?00m in compensation to rival telecoms companies over delays installing high-speed internet connections.Ofcom found that BT broke rules put in place to stop Openreach, its subsidiary that controls the UK broadband infrastructure network, abusing its ?significant market power? by cutting compensation payments to rivals, blaming installation delays on factors beyond its control when this was not the case.BT said it expected to pay out ?00m in compensation to rivals including Sky, Vodafone and TalkTalk for the ?serious breach? of Ofcom?s rules.?The size of our fine reflects how important these rules are to protect competition and, ultimately, consumers and businesses,? said Gaucho Rasmussen, investigations director at Ofcom. ?Our message is clear ? we will not tolerate this sort of behaviour. Millions of people rely on BT?s network for the phone and broadband services they use every day.?Compensation must be paid to affected providers within 12 months, Ofcom said.The record ?2m penalty, which was reduced from ?0m after BT admitted full liability and agreed to pay back rivals, is more than 11 times greater than the previous largest fine levied on a telecoms operator by Ofcom. Last year, Vodafone was fined ?.7m for taking pay-as-you-go customers? money without providing a service. BT?s fine is more than seven times that of the second largest penalty handed down, the ?.7m ITV had to pay in 2008 over the ?abuse? of premium-rate phone lines in a number of hit shows.Ofcom?s investigation into BT focused on the installation of high-speed business lines, known as ethernet services, which provide connections for big businesses as well as organisations including schools, hospitals and libraries, between January 2013 and December 2014. It was instigated after a complaint from Vodafone, which relies on BT ethernet services to transmit data between its mobile masts. Vodafone accused Openreach of failing to meet its 30-day installation guarantee but then reclassifying the delay as having been agreed by rivals which allowed it to avoid paying compensation.?These high-speed lines are a vital part of this country?s digital backbone,? said Rasmussen. ?We found BT broke our rules by failing to pay other telecoms companies proper compensation when these services were not provided on time.?BT was also fined ?00,000 for ?failing to provide information to Ofcom?.?We apologise wholeheartedly for the mistakes Openreach made in the past when processing orders for a number of high-speed business connections,? said Clive Selley, chief executive of Openreach. ?This shouldn?t have happened and we fully accept Ofcom?s findings.? A spokesman for Vodafone said: ?We hope this ruling will encourage BT Openreach to finally drop the unacceptable practices it has used to avoid paying compensation for late delivery of fixed fibre lines, which have impacted businesses across the country as well as our own 4G roll-out.?Less than half (48.8%) of high speed ethernet installations were completed within 30 days, according to Openreach?s own statistics for the final quarter of last year.However, Openreach said that almost 87% of installations are completed by the original agreed date, and that the number of outstanding orders is at a 34-month low.Rivals have repeatedly called for Openreach, responsible for building and maintaining the tens of millions of copper and fibre lines that run from telephone exchanges to homes and businesses across the UK, to be split from BT.They argue that BT has dragged its heels in opening the network to their engineers, which has hampered their ability to offer homes superfast broadband access.This month BT finally agreed a halfway house deal to legally separate Openreach, after two years of wrangling with Ofcom, which wants to strengthen the independence of the broadband network operator to promote competition and boost superfast services.The ?2m penalty follows a bad week for BT after Ofcom fined subsidiary Plusnet ?80,000 for continuing to charge more than 1,000 customers more than ?00,000 after they had cancelled their accounts.The fine is the latest headache for Gavin Patterson, the chief executive of BT, who has endured a torrid year that included an accounting scandal at its Italian operation that wiped ?bn off its shares.?The investigation ? revealed we fell short of the high standards we expect in serving our communications provider customers,? Patterson said. ?We take this issue very seriously and we have put in place measures, controls and people to prevent it happening again. My management team and I are determined that BT applies the highest standards when serving our customers.?This month BT, which is to introduce inflation-busting price rises for its customers, denied it was forcing them to foot the bill to pay for its new ?.2bn Champions League football rights deal.
Twinkle Khanna, who maintains that it is extremely difficult to troll her, often gets trolled by her son Aarav, whether it is for her driving skills or her self-confessed bad films she has done. In an interview with DNA, Twinkle talked about the kind of parent she is."I hope I am (a friendly mother). I try to be. Aarav's friends call me 'savage'. I believe it's a compliment in today's times. It sounds awful, but I believe it's a good thing. My son says so, at least," she revealed.Twinkle is often clicked going on vacations with her children, Aarav and Nitara, and husband Akshay Kumar. However, she tries to shield her children from overexposure in the media. "See, I am a mother at the end of the day, so it's my duty to protect my kids. I don't like putting pictures of either Nitara or Aarav because they might be kids but they also need their privacy," she said, reasoning that having well-known parents does not mean that they have no right to privacy.
The Supreme Court today said the Aadhaar card can't be made mandatory by the government for extending the benefits of its welfare schemes to the people.The apex court, however, said the government cannot be stopped from using Aadhaar - or the the unique identification number - in other schemes like the opening of bank accounts.Last week, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had said the Aadhaar card may become the only identity card in future, and will be mandatory for filing of Income Tax returns to curb tax evasion and frauds.Replying to the debate on the Finance Bill in the Lok Sabha, Jaitley said that Aadhaar may become the only card in future replacing all other types of identity cards such as Voter ID and PAN cards.The government has also said the Aadhaar card is a must for anyone seeking to obtain or renew a driver's license, a new telephone number as well as for existing connections to stay operational after February 2018. In a controversial decision, it has also been mandated for children to get their mid-day meals and for 11 other government schemes.The critics of Aadhaar claim the government is violating a Supreme Court order of October 2015 which specified that the Universal Identification Document cannot be made mandatory for government schemes. The Supreme Court today said it will set up a seven-judge bench to hear the pleas challenging Aadhaar. "But right now, it is not possible," a bench of Chief Justice Jagdish Singh Khehar, Justice DY Chandrachud and Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul said.Senior counsel Shyam Divan had challenged a spare of orders issued by the government making Aadhaar mandatory to access benefits under various schemes.?

Colombo, Mar 26 (PTI) India will become the worlds youngest country by 2020 with an average age of 29, Indias envoy in Sri Lanka said today. Sixty-four per cent of Indias population will be in the working age group by 2020, High Commissioner of India to Sri Lanka Taranjith Singh Sandhu said while delivering a foreign policy lecture here. "With western Europe, the US, South Korea, Japan and even China aging, this demographic potential offers India an unprecedented edge which could further contribute to the GDP growth rate," he said. "The core aim of Indias foreign policy is to meet the developmental aspirations of its 1.25 billion people. Our diplomacy is for our development," the envoy said. 
Meat items are flying off the menu from a majority of eateries in Uttar Pradesh as a host of illegal abattoirs have been forced to shut shop under the Yogi Adityanath government.The Muslim-dominated western parts, adjoining the national Capital, are among the worst affected, a reality check by MAIL TODAY found.While the debilitated meat supply highlights the fact that erstwhile governments in UP had turned a blind eye to unlawful slaughterhouses, it also proves the incumbent government had no consolidated plan to avoid a crisis-like situation. "I have not seen such scarcity of raw meat in the last 35 years that we have been in business," said Mohamad Khalid, owner of Al-Nafis dhaba at Dasna on NH 24. "The last 10 days have been harrowing. This is worse than the demonetisation phase," said Khalid, the second generation owner of the popular dhaba serving highway frequenters.RS 4,000 CRORE IN LOSSESThe accumulated losses in the last two months since the BJP manifesto promised closure of illegal slaughterhouses runs into Rs 4,000 crore, according to All India Meat and Livestock Exporters Association. Association members recently met Yogi Adityanath in Lucknow and requested him to intervene in protecting legal business and clear confusion.Four mechanised plants, which slaughter and process buffalo meat, were shut last week by district administration across UP. Two of them were in Meerut and one each in Bijnor and Saharanpur.The exporters' association said while the move by the government is against illegal slaughterhouses, an overzealous tribe of officers and vigilante groups have forced even legal traders to suspend operations. "Transporting meat is a risky task nowadays and only very few vehicle-owners are ready to stick their necks out," said a meat trader.But numbers speak for themselves. "UP has only 41 slaughter houses, which are certified by the Union ministry. These units contribute to 60-70 per cent of the total export of buffalo meat, worth around Rs 320 billion. The fear of closure is among the owners' mind, who are now being troubled by several agencies," Fauzan Alavi, member secretary of the exporters' association told MAIL TODAY.CERTIFICATION PROCESS A TEDIOUS PROCESS, SAYS SMALL SLAUGHTERHOUSESSeveral small illegal slaughterhouses that the MAIL TODAY team spoke to were united in complaining that certification process for an abattoir is a tedious process, often requiring multiple clearances at the state and central level. "It is not feasible for a small operator to attain all the clearances," said one such owner, who downed shutters soon after Yogi's ascension as CM.The closure of these slaughterhouses has a ripple effect on smaller units selling meat or cooked preparations. A number of small eateries and mobile food carts in Muzaffarnagar and Ghaziabad have been out of business.Chetan, a chicken shop owner at Murad Nagar in Ghaziabad, told MAIL TODAY that 20 members of his family are dependent on his shop, running for seven years. But now, uncertainty looms on them as he could be forced to look for other job. "Police warned me to shut the shop. I have put a curtain at the entry of my shop to keep business limited only to loyal customers. I will apply for a license at the tehsil office and if I do not get it, I would think of another business like selling vegetables," he said."Taking surprise decisions is the BJP's trademark," said owner of a food cart, Ishaan Qureshi, in Muzaffarnagar. "First it was note ban and now meat ban. We live in an area where economy depends on unorganised sectors. Now people are losing bread and jobs."Meat shops and eateries in proximity with the national Capital still had an easy run as they shifted their supply route towards Delhi's Ghazipur meat mandi."Our hotel has a daily consumption of 30-35 kg of buffalo meat that was earlier available in slaughterhouses locally. Now, we are purchasing it from Ghazipur at Rs 170-180 per kg, which is Rs 30 higher than earlier," said Mohammad Akhlak, owner of Shahdan Muslim Dhaba on NH 24. "Ninety per cent of eateries have either suspended operation temporarily or raised prices."Akhlak said in the last one week police vigilance has been high and seizure of meat consignment always looms large during transportation. There is total fear in the mind of street vendors and roadside eateries about restarting their businesses, he added.

Ajinkya Rahane has been one of India's most dependable batsmen in recent times, especially in overseas conditions where others have failed to deliver. (SCORECARD)Rahane is a proven performer abroad where he has scored 1588 runs in 21 matches at an average of 51.22, including five hundreds and eight fifties. Ajinkya Rahane scratchy, down on confidence: Sourav Ganguly to India TodayHowever, his performance at home has not been up to the mark when compared to his away numbers. In 16 matches, Rahane has scored 954 runs at an average of 38.15, including three hundreds and as many fifties. (Dharamsala Test, Day 2: Key highlights)One had expected that Rahane would improve his stats at home in the marathon season which will end after the ongoing fourth Test against Australia in Dharamsala. Rahane started India's home season of 13 Tests with a bang against New Zealand where he scored 347 runs in three matches, including a century and a fifty. (India vs Australia, 4th Test, Day 2: As it happened)However, he failed to sustain the momentum in the following series against England where he managed only 63 runs in the first three Tests before being ruled out of the last two matches with a finger injury.He returned to the team in the one-off Test against Bangladesh and scored 82 in the first innings and 28 in the second as India thrashed their neighbours comprehensively. (Nathan Lyon hurts India after Lokesh Rahul, Cheteshwar Pujara fifties)But against Australia, Rahane has again been found struggling to make runs. He has so far managed to score just 160 runs with an average of 26.66, including a half-century.In the series-deciding fourth Test against the Aussies, Rahane was handed the additional responsibility of captaining the side after Virat Kohli was ruled out following a shoulder injury.

India appeared to have the upper hand before Nathan Lyon (4/67) intervened after tea.In the first over of the final session, Lyon sent back Pujara for 57 and went on to dismiss Karun Nair, Rahane and Ravichandran Ashwin to deflate the hosts. (STATS: Ravindra Jadeja 10th Indian to achieve all-round double of 1000 runs, 100 wickets in Tests)Rahane found himself in the line of fire and the otherwise dependable batsman made things difficult for himself by trying to pull and hook his way out of trouble. He was dismissed for 46. Reflecting on Rahane's inconsistent form, former India captain Sourav Ganguly on Sunday told India Today that the Mumbaikar has been scratchy and down on confidence. (Lokesh Rahul seeks second innings redemption in Dharamsala)"Ajinkya Rahane is scratchy. It is not the Rahane we have seen over a long period of time. Think about the Rahane at Lord's (2013) where it was seaming, decking, bouncing and he just batted as if it was a different track. "Imagine his hundreds in Australia. He is just a bit out of the place at the moment, maybe mentally... the confidence has gone down a bit because he hasn't had a good series against England," Ganguly told India Today. (Gallery)
Switching off lights and electrical appliances during the Earth Hour initiative this year, Delhi saved around 290 MW of power, the capital's distribution companies (discoms) announced on Sunday.The global Earth Hour initiative aimed at energy conservation was observed between 8:30 pm and 9:30 pm on Saturday."This is more than last year when Delhi had saved around 230 MW," a spokesperson of power major BSES said here. The discom said its twin arms BSES Rajdhani Power Ltd (BRPL) and BSES Yamuna Power Ltd (BYPL), which cater to large parts of Delhi, saved around 113 MW and 95 MW of electricity, respectively, making for a total of 208 MW saving in BSES areas.BRPL and BYPL had also switched off all non-essential lights at their over 400 offices, spread across an area of around 950 sq km, during the appointed hour.With its 40 lakh consumers, BSES areas in the capital last year had saved around 207 MW during this annual event.Tata Power Delhi Distribution Ltd saved 82 MW of power during Earth Hour 2017, the company said in a statement. It had managed to save around 55 MW during the event last year.AWARENESS ON CLIMATE CHANGE Tata Power, which distributes in North and North-West Delhi, said it "also organised several candlelight marches during the Earth Hour in association with consumers and residents' welfare associations in its distribution area," towards sensitising on energy conservation.

Mumbai, Mar 26 (PTI) Banker Uday Kotak has said the BJPs win in the recent state polls is positive for economic reforms and the government should now focus on re-activating "animal spirits" of the private sector to invest. "I think we just need to make sure that we are focused on growing the economy, getting the private sectors animal spirits back and that will create jobs," Kotak told PTI over the weekend. Terming BJPs landslide victory in the crucial state of Uttar Pradesh as a positive development, Kotak said it is a "big signal" for stability and continuity in economic policies. A two-thirds majority in the countrys most populous state, that sends the maximum number of Parliamentarians (80 to the Lower House and 30 to the Upper House, where Opposition Congress is in majority), will help BJP gain upper hand after the 2018 elections to the Rajya Sabha. The Narendra Modi government has been facing stiff opposition in getting crucial bills passed in the Rajya Sabha due to lack of adequate numbers. The BJP and allies have won 324 seats in the 403- member UP assembly.

While Cristiano Ronaldo kept moving up Europe's all-time scorers list on Saturday, a demoralizing loss to Bulgaria endangered the Netherlands' World Cup qualification.With two goals in Portugal's 3-0 win over Hungary, Ronaldo moved into fourth place on the all-time scorers list for European nations.Ronaldo's 70 in 137 appearances trail only Miroslav Klose (71), Sandor Kocsis (75) and Ferenc Puskas (84).Here is a look at World Cup qualifiers in Europe:BULGARIA STUN NETHERLANDSTeenager Matthijs de Ligt's dream debut for the Netherlands quickly turned into a nightmare as he handed Bulgaria an early goal.Just five minutes into the match De Ligt let a speculative ball fall over his shoulder before he collided with goalkeeper Jeroen Zoet, allowing Spas Delev to tap in.Delev made it 2-0 in the 20th when he curled a shot past De Ligt's attempted block and into the bottom corner of Zoet's goal.Injuries had forced coach Danni Blind to make the risky choice of De Ligt who, at 17, became the youngest Netherlands debutant since Mauk Weber in 1931.After the stunning loss, the manager took the blame."I blame myself," Blind told national broadcaster NOS, adding that, "It can't go on like this. Things have to change."The Netherlands, which failed to qualify for the European Championship last year, looks likely to struggle to reach the World Cup in Russia.France stayed on top of the group with 13 points after beating Luxembourg 3-1 thanks to Olivier Giroud's double and a penalty by Antoine Griezmann.Sweden is second with 10 points after thrashing Belarus 4-0. The Netherlands slid to fourth with seven points, behind Bulgaria with nine.RONALDO AT THE DOUBLERonaldo appears to have found his ideal partner up front for in Andre Silva.The 21-year-old striker scored Portugal's opener in the 32nd before quickly getting Ronaldo on track.Ronaldo struck both goals from outside the area, first slashing home a left-footer off Silva's pass, followed by a right-footed free kick from an angle to seal the win in Lisbon."We started off slowly, but the first goal gave our confidence a boost and the other goals came naturally," Ronaldo told Portuguese television.Portugal strengthened its hold on second place with 12 points, opening a gap over Hungary, which stayed with seven points in third.Switzerland earned a fifth win in as many matches after beating Latvia 1-0 to remain on top of the group with 15 points.Still stuck at the foot of the table, Andorra nevertheless savored the end to a losing streak that had lasted 58 competitive matches stretching over 11 years after drawing with Faroe Islands 0-0.LUKAKU RESCUES BELGIUMRomelu Lukaku saved Belgium's place at the top of Group H, snatching a 1-1 draw in Brussels after being frustrated all night by an unyielding Greece defense. Lukaku chested down the fall and fired past goalkeeper Stefano Kapino with only two minutes of regular time remaining.
In his first ever interaction with the media after losing the chair to Adityanath Yogi, former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Akhilesh Yadav on Saturday cautioned Yogi to keep a distance from his lions."My lions (Gujarat Babbar Sher) are hungry...I would like to caution you not to go near them as they can harm you," Akhilesh said in a press conference at the Samajwadi Party's office.The statement was an indirect assault on the newly formed government's crackdown on the slaughterhouses as was promised in the manifesto of the BJP.It is to be mentioned that Akhilesh has "imported" Gujarat lions for his dream project Etawan Lion Safari and as per the records of the state government, nearly Rs 1 lakh is spent every month on food and upbringing of each pair of animals. Due to shortage of red meat, the lions are at present fed with chicken meat and arrangements are being made to import red meat from neighbouring states.TAKE CARE OF MY PEACOCKS, AKHILESH ASKSAkhilesh also requested the CM to take care of his peacocks. "When I used to live there, three peacocks came there (5 Kalidas Marg, the official residence of the CM) and were living with us like family members. I have come to know that Yogiji will be opening a gaushala (cow shed) there. It is my humble request to him to also take care of my peacocks," he said.Taking a jibe at the recent Shudhikaran of the CM's house, Akhilesh said he will take more effective steps for the same."When we will return to power in 2022, I will ensure that the entire residence is washed with Gangajal. Fire tenders will be pressed into service for the same," he said.AKHILESH TAUNTS OFFICIALSAkhilesh also expressed surprise on the "skills" of government officials. "If I had the idea about the brooming skills of these officials, I could have utilised them effectively," he said while taunting the officials who were seen cleaning their offices after taking cleanliness oath.Taking a jibe at the media Akhilesh said, "I am waiting for the days when you (media) will publish Yogi's picture along with incident of rapes and murder as you used to do with me."Akhilesh also informed that his party has reviewed the reason behind the land slide defeat in the elections. "The review is still going on and we are introspecting our weaknesses," he added.ALSO READ | Mulayam, Shivpal skip Akhilesh-led Samajwadi Party's national executive
A gunfight broke out inside a crowded Cincinnati nightclub early Sunday, leaving one man dead and 15 others wounded after a dispute among several patrons escalated into a shootout, authorities said.No suspects were in custody by Sunday night in the shooting at the Cameo club, which has a history of gun violence, and police said there was no indication of any terrorism link.Cincinnati Police Chief Eliot Isaac said one of the wounded was in "extremely critical condition," while a hospital spokeswoman said two victims were listed in critical condition.Police began receiving calls at 1:30 a.m. about gunshots at the club near the Ohio River east of downtown Cincinnati. Isaac said some 200 people were inside the club, one of the few hip-hop venues in the city, for music and dancing.Isaac identified the dead man as 27-year-old O'Bryan Spikes, but provided no other details. He said 15 others were injured, with some already treated and released from hospitals."What we know at this point in the investigation is that several local men got into some type of dispute inside the bar, and it escalated into shots being fired from several individuals," Isaac said. It wasn't clear how many people fired shots.'IT WAS JUST CRAZY' Club patron Mauricio Thompson described a chaotic scene in which as many as 20 shots were fired as people scrambled to get away. He said there was a fight and people were yelling for security to intervene before the gunfire began."Once I got outside, people coming out bloody, gunshot wounds on them, some of their friends carrying them to the car, rushing them to the hospital," Thompson told WCPO-TV. "It was just crazy."Police Sgt. Daniel Hils said the large crowd at the club was a factor in the number of people who suffered gunshot wounds."When you're talking about something tightly packed like that, I think intended targets aren't going to be the only thing that's hit," said Hils, who is president of the Fraternal Order of Police local. "When you starting throwing lead around, and there's a lot of other people standing around, then the other people are going to get hit."Isaac said the club has its own security operation that uses detection wands and pat-downs, but that police believe several firearms got inside. Four officers were working security in the club's parking lot and some tried unsuccessfully to revive the man who died.Cameo's Facebook profile said it caters to college students on Friday nights, when anyone over 18 is allowed in, while Saturdays are "grown and sexy night" for ages 21 and older. The page was taken down later Sunday.'JUST A LOT OF CHAOS' The club has a history of gun violence, including a shooting inside the club on New Year's Day in 2015 and one in the parking lot in September of that year, City Manager Harry Black said.Police Capt. Kim Williams said there was "just a lot of chaos, obviously, when shots were fired.""Saturday night, it is a very young crowd. We have had incidents here in the past, but this is by far the worst," she said.Referring to initial speculation about possible terrorism, Mayor John Cranley said: "What difference does that make to the victims? Innocent people were shot."He called the shootings "unacceptable" and said authorities would work to find ways to prevent such violence.A single body was removed by the coroner shortly after 6 a.m. A federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives team was also at the scene.Among the injured, five were treated at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center and released, hospital spokeswoman Kelly Martin said. She said two people were in critical condition and another three were listed in stable condition by late afternoon. She had no details on the types of injuries or the ages of the victims. Other injured people were taken to or drove themselves to other hospitals.Authorities asked anyone with information to come forward. Investigators were checking to see if surveillance cameras were working, Williams said.An Associated Press phone call to the club Sunday night went unanswered.The area is mostly industrial but also home to several nightclubs with a smattering of homes. A regional airport is nearby. The neighborhood is fairly desolate at night, with the exception of the nightlife scene and 24-hour gas stations. The road where the club is located was easily cordoned off by a single police cruiser and officer at either end.First responders had problems reaching the shooting victims because the parking lots were full, Sgt. Eric Franz told the Cincinnati Enquirer.Ohio Gov. John Kasich said on Twitter that he was "saddened to learn about last night's shooting" and that he was offering the state's assistance.Watch video here 
The controverisal Finance Bill of 2017, that was introduced by Finance Minister Arun Jaitely as a Money Bill in the Lok Sabha, and gotten it passed with the majority the Bharatiya Janata Party enjoys in the lower house, was reintroduced today after the Rajya Sabha recommended five amendments to it. As predicted by experts, the Lok Sabha rejected the amendments suggested by the upper house and passed the bill in its original form.Â  The Lok Sabha introduced by Jaitley was strongly opposed by the opposition parties of RSP, TMC and BJD. The Opposition has termed the introduction of the amendments as "back-door" legislating and taking away right of Parliament to frame laws.Jaitley defended the amendments with the argument that they were all "incidental provisions" to the Finance Bill. He said the amendment is made to provide for uniform service conditions to its member judges. Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan had overruled the Opposition's objections, saying that rules permit "non-taxation proposals" to be included in the Finance Bill. "Incidental provisions can be made. That is why, keeping in view that rule 219 does not specifically bar inclusion of non-taxation proposals in a Finance Bill, I rule out the Point of Order," Mahajan had said while rejecting the objection moved by NK Premachandran (RSP).

A fringe Muslim group in West Bengal has demanded the removal of a statue of "Bangabandhu" Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the founder of Bangladesh from a government hostel in Kolkata.Terming the statue "unethical and anti-Islamic", the All Bengal Minority Youth Federation (ABMYF) has opposed the statue at the government run Baker hostel. The group says, the hostel is meant for Muslim students and since it has a mosque in its premises, such a statue could not be allowed in an "Islamic atmosphere".The 110 year-old?hostel, located in central Kolkata was home to the great leader between 1945 and 1946 when he was a student at the erstwhile Islamia college in Kolkata. In 1998, the then left front government in the state had converted his room on the third floor of the hostel into a memorial and alter a white marble statue of Bangabandhu was also installed."We are religious people. It is our free right to follow our religion as per the Indian Constitution . We cannot read Namaz and also install statues at the same place. It is defiling to our religion," claimed Md. Quamruzzaman, general secretary of the minority body."No Muslim institutions have statues inside them. Aligarh Muslim University was built by Sir Syed Ahmed Khan but his statue was never installed at the university," he argued.MAMATA BANERJEE EMBARRASSED?

While the lives of Uttar Pradesh's Romeos and Juliets have taken a tragic turn with critics accusing the state's week-old BJP government of "moral policing", the star-crossed lovers may find refuge in the nation's Capital.The culture of India is love and resistance, AAP minister Kapil Mishra said on Saturday. Speaking at the MAIL TODAY Culture Conclave, he announced that both Romeo and Juliet are welcome in the city and there would be no Mogambo to object, referring to one of Hindi cinema's best-known villains.His remarks came against the backdrop of the UP government's controversial anti-Romeo drive, described as a crackdown on people harassing women in public places. "Every year when the tourism calendar of the government of India is sent to all countries, there are two places which are always mentioned- Taj Mahal and Khajuraho. One symbolises divine love and the other material love," the city's tourism and culture minister said.Indian culture is known to embrace dissenting voices, he pointed out. "We are a flexible society. People who invaded and made an attempt to destroy our culture eventually blended in."UP GOVERNMENT'S ACTION CRITICIZED ON SOCIAL MEDIAThe Uttar Pradesh government's action has sparked criticism on social media video with commentators terming it infringement of individual rights with TV footage showing young men being caned by police and others being made to do sit-ups as punishment."After taking over as tourism and culture minister, I got to know that a concert of (Pakistani singer) Ghulam Ali sahab had been cancelled in Mumbai. The first thing I did was to call him and invite him to Delhi for a concert," Mishra recalled. "Ghulam Ali is one of those artists whose music is immensely popular among Indian soldiers. His music is without boundaries. Our culture is flexible and convergent."The minister compared Indian culture to the voices of Kabir and Maharishi Charvaka- known for their anti-norm views. Some people are trying to enforce uniformity is the garb of unity, he said. "India with such diverse culture is a culture of resistance and we should celebrate it."The Aam Aadmi Party and other critics have accused the ruling BJP at the Centre as well as affiliated groups of trying to muzzle dissent and paint nonconformists as "anti-nationals".ON RAMJAS, JNU INCIDENTSTalking about clashes at educational institutions in recent months including the violence at Delhi's Ramjas College in February and JNU last year, Mishra said university culture is all about healthy discussion on politics and policies."It is wrong to term the voices of dissent as Naxalite, terrorist or anarchist. However, the anti national slogans that were raised in JNU are unacceptable and people responsible for it should be behind bars," he said. "But hitting a college professor in the name of culture is not a trait of a Hindu."The Capital will hold cultural and tourism festivals in six months on the lines of Dubai and Singapore, the minister announced."We are working on the packaging and the branding of the Capital," he said. "We are introducing seven tourist circuits. We have collaborated with INTACT to protect 250 archeological sites in the Capital." MISHRA APPRECIATES CENTRE'S SUPPORTAmid all the criticism for the Centre, the minister did not hold back in appreciating the support he received from the Modi government."The Centre and Delhi government are closely working in tandem to promote tourism and clean the Yamuna," he said."We believe, to promote culture it is important to connect the society with the river. Therefore, we organised a mega Yamuna aarti and are also going to develop river tourism and a `200-crore budget has been earmarked for this year. We have a 22-km stretch of clean water which is still an unexplored point. We have begun water sports. We will develop a 5-km ecological river front."The city's nightlife is an important part of the culture and it's beyond going to India Gate or nightclubs, Mishra argued. "The nightlife ensures the law and order of a place," he said.ALSO READ | No moral policing in the name of anti-Romeo squads, says UP government

The Indian Army, after consultations with the Defence Ministry, is considering cutting down the numbers of its sahayaks or 'buddies' by 25 percent. This would translate to around 10,000 jawans as there are currently about 40,000 sahayaks in the Indian Army. The move would come in the wake of the controversy over the tasks Indian Army sahayaks perform for officers and junior commissioned officers.Under the army's 'buddy's system, sahayak jawans are attached to officers and junior commissioned officers. A sahayak's tasks include working with the officer or JCO for army-related duties. According to top army sources, the 10,000 sahayak jawans will be replaced by civilians. The civilian substitutes will be employed for officers in static formations such as the Army Headquarters or units in the Delhi area and not operational locations like battalions, brigades and division and corps headquarters. Once their civilian replacements are in the place, the 10,000 sahayak jawans will be moved to army formations across the country. This is perhaps the first step in the dismantling of the army's sahayak or 'buddy' system. The Indian Navy and the Indian Air Force do not have such a system in place.The age-old system recently came into the spotlight after a few jawans posted grievance-filled videos on social media. The videos criticised the buddy system, with the soldiers alleging that they were often made to perform menial tasks for the officers whom they were assigned to ALSO READ: Buddy no more?

When I approached the Censor Board chief Pahlaj Nihalani, he told me: PM ka radio show hai, delete the line," director Chhara was quoted as saying.When asked under what guidelines Chhara was asked to get the phrase deleted from his film, the director said, "We were not given an oral hearing before censor board members, which is supposed to be mandatory. The board, despite granting us an A (adults only) certificate, asked for certain scenes involving torture, and bomb blast, to be chopped mercilessly. If we comply, the impact of those scenes would be lost altogether."Sameer, directed by Dakxin Chhara, is a thriller based on the 2008 Ahmedabad serial blasts and among others, it stars Seema Biswas and Anjali Patil.Chhara at the moment plans to challenge the CBFC's 'Mann ki baat' decision.

Yogiji, don't divert people's attention and constitute anti-daru squad (anti-liquor squad)," Tejaswi, the younger son of Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) chief Lalu Prasad Yadav, told media.Tejaswi said if Adityanath is a 'Yogi' and an honest advocate of religion, he should order a total liquor ban in Uttar Pradesh like in Bihar.

He could not serve the nation and its people while alive. But in death, 22-year-old ITBP recruit Roshan Kumar became the saviour for half a dozen families. Days after he received news of his first posting with the Indo-Tibetan Border Police, the Uttarakhand native died in a road accident last week in Delhi's Dwarka area where he was visiting relatives. But six of his vital organs became life-savers for as many transplant patients at hospitals in the Capital. India has a huge gap in demand and supply of organs. Experts say many people are unwilling to donate relatives' organs due to religious beliefs, because they don't understand how it works, or because it is too difficult to do so due to red tape. Roshan belonged to an army background, and was brought up by an uncle. "When he was just one year old, his parents died. I looked after him. From his very childhood and schooldays he wanted to become a soldier and serve the country. For this, he worked very hard. His dream was about to become reality. Now Roshan is not at the border to protect the country. But I am proud to say that he served the nation by saving six lives," Roshan's uncle told Mail Today, requesting anonymity. According to government data, about 2 lakh people are waitlisted for kidneys and 30,000 for livers. Legal donations meet about 3 to 5 per cent of the demand. ROSHAN WAS HIT BY A SPEEDING BIKEIn desperation, some patients on the waiting list seek the services of middlemen to procure organs for money illegally. Dr AK Rai, medical superintendent of Safdarjung Hospital, told Mail Today, "Last week, late night we received a call from a Dwarka-based hospital that they were referring a severely injured accident patient to us. We activated our expert team as the patient had very little chance of survival. Even in the time of grief, family members of the deceased agreed to donate the organs of their young son to fulfil his only wish to serve the country." Roshan was on foot when he was hit by a speeding bike and fell, receiving serious brain injuries.Doctors retrieved the organs in quick time. "After the patient was declared brain dead and the family agreed to donate his all organs, experts' team from NOTTO (National Organ & Tissue Transplant Organisation) and Safdarjung Hospital started the procedure of organ retrieval," said (Prof) Dr Anup Kumar, head of renal transplant department at Safdarjung. HE SERVED HIS NATION IN DEATH"All potential organs such as eyes, heart, liver, kidneys and intestine were procured, which gave fresh lease of life to six patients. Two people got eyes and one patient at AIIMS received the heart. Two patients got kidneys, one got a liver and the intestines were sent to Medanta hospital." Roshan's act is a message of brotherhood and harmony for the nation, say doctors. "He is a gem," Dr Kumar said. "One of his kidneys was transplanted to a Muslim patient at Safardjung Hospital who was on dialysis for two years and could not find any donor." Speaking to Mail Today, 47-year-old Parvez Alam who stays at Khanpur in south Delhi, said, "I am blessed that I have received a kidney from a Hindu patient who was brain dead. Roshan proved Hindu-Muslim Bhai Bhai. I was searching for a kidney for the past two years, but the miracle happened when I was in the last stage of dialysis. May Roshan's soul rest in peace." On Tuesday, Safdarjung Hospital felicitated Roshan's family. "If a person is dedicated to fulfil his dreams, he or she can do it even when not alive," said Dr Sangeeta Sehrawat, organ retrieval coordinator at the institute. "One needs only determination and this was proved by this inspiring young defence personnel."
When a disaster like fire or earthquake strikes, our first reaction is to grab our dear ones and run. But what about the times when we get separated from someone we love in a moment of such crisis?That's where real life heroes come in.After an apartment in Santa Monica, California, caught fire recently, somebody's pet dog got trapped inside the burning building. When firefighter Andrew Klein noticed, he climbed into the building and rescued the poor dog.However, the dog, who's called Nalu, was no longer breathing and didn't have a pulse. Nalu had been "overcome by heat and smoke," the Santa Monica Fire Department said in a statement.Klein, a fireman from the Santa Monica Fire Department, did not give up. He performed a CPR on Nalu as people and his colleagues looked on. Nalu was also given oxygen through an oxygen mask designed for animals. Around 20 minutes after the CPR, as Klein and others kept coaxing him, Nalu began to breathe on his own again. "It was pretty amazing because I've been on a number of animal rescues like this that did not come out the same way that Nalu's story did," Klein told KTLA 5. "It was definitely a win for the whole team and the department that we got him back."Like Dr Derek Shepherd used to say on Grey's Anatomy, "It's a beautiful day to save lives." It always is.|| Read more at FYI ||Is culling the solution to stray dog menace in Kerala?Chandigarh youth spins dog and mercilessly hurls it against the wall
Chennai Police Commissioner Sebastian George has been transferred out of the city ahead of by-polls in former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa's constituency, Tamil media reports said on Saturday.This development comes after the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), the leading Opposition party in the the Tamil Nadu Assembly, told the Election Commission that the police commissioner might act in a way that favoured the ruling party - the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) - and asked that he be transferred, Puthiya Thalaimurai (PT) reported.The poll panel has said a new commissioner of police will be appointed soon, the news channel tweeted.RK NAGAR TO GO ON POLLS ON APRIL 12Jayalalithaa's constituency, Chennai's Dr Radhakrishnan (RK) Nagar, will elect a new MLA on April 12.With the polls just around the corner, as many as 127 nominations were filed on Friday, Thanthi TV reported.82 of those nominations, including those of DMK candidatate Maruthu Ganesh, and rival AIADMK candidates E Madhusudhanan and TTV Dinakaran, were accepted, the channel said.Madhusudhanan, a former Presidium Chairman, represents a faction of the AIADMK represented by former Chief Minister O Panneerselvam. TTV Dinakaran, the AIADMK's Deputy General Secretary, represents the faction led by party chief VK Sasikala.TWIN LEAF VERDICTThe Election Commission on Wednesday said neither camp could use the AIADMK's name or its symbol, the iconic 'Rettai Ilai' or 'twin leaf.'So the Panneerselvam and Sasikala camps will contest under the names 'AIADMK Puratchi Thalaivi Amma' and 'AIADMK Amma,' respectively.WHO IS GEORGE?Sebastian George is a 1984 batch officer who began his career in Tamil Nadu police force in 1987. George's way of handling protests and curbing unruly crowd, especially the way he handled the agitation against Kudankulam Nuclear PowerPoint and Mullaiperuyar issue, caught Jayalalithaa's attention.It is expected that ADGP (CB-CID) will be the new commissioner of Chennai.

The Jammu and Kashmir government has decided to say goodbye to the practice of asking government teachers to be part of election duties. The move which has come as a sigh of relief is aimed at ensuring that the education system doesn't suffer and get distracted. While announcing this, Education Minister Altaf Bukhari said, "We want to provide teachers a congenial atmosphere and minimize disruption of academic activities. After brainstorming and thorough deliberations, it has been felt that teachers should be allowed to concentrate on their primary goal of imparting education and for that they should be relieved of all other duties".The decision has been hailed by the teachers' community and the parents in equal measure.Most of the people have been complaining about this in the past. The state of Jammu and Kashmir has taken a lead in this direction. This will infuse a fresh lease of life into Jammu and Kashmir's otherwise derailed education system. "Exempting us from all non-academic assignments including election duties to help them focus on their prime task of teaching is a great step. We all are welcoming it", said a teacher. Next month the state will go for bypolls for the parliament seats in Srinagar and Anantnag.
Imphal, Mar 24 (PTI) The newly elected BJP-led Manipur government today decided to do away with the process of interview in direct recruitment for junior level posts in all departments. A meeting of the state cabinet chaired by Chief Minister Nongthombam Biren Singh also decided to set up an anti- corruption cell at the Chief Ministers Secretariat. "The cabinet decided to discontinue the stage of interview in direct recruitment for junior level posts in all departments under Manipur government with immediate effect, " an official statement said. It also decided to amend the existing recruitment rules for Grade III and IV posts accordingly, it added. The step will help government curb corruption, assist in more objective selection in a transparent manner and ease the problems of poor people, it said. 
External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj has said that the government is not yet ready to accept the US' version on a list of 271 Indians living in that country. The Trump administration has identified them as living in the US as 'illegal' migrants.Sushma Swaraj has said that the US has given a list of 271 people claiming they were illegal migrants from India, but the government has not accepted it and would allow their deportation only after proper verification. Speaking during the Question Hour in the Rajya Sabha yesterday, Sushma said, "We have not accepted this list and have sought more details. We have said that it is only after we verify the details, can we issue an emergency certificate for their deportation." 'NO CHANGE IN US POLICIES'Addressing the concerns expressed by some Rajya Sabha MPs, Sushma said it would not be correct to say that there has been a change in the US policies after the Trump administration has come to power.Several members expressed concern over the effects of the steps being taken by the Donald Trump administration on Indian citizens including skilled professionals living there.Referring to skilled workers, Swaraj said regarding H1B and L1 visas for professionals, four bills have come to the US Congress but they have not been passed.PROFESSIONALS VS ILLEGAL MIGRANTSShe said the government was engaging with the US at the highest level to ensure that the interests of Indian people or the IT industry are not affected."We are conveying to them that IT professionals are not stealing jobs but contributing to the US economy and making it stronger," the Minister said.While greeting Swaraj on her recovery after having been unwell, Anand Sharma of Congress said it is important that skilled professionals are not confused with illegal migrants.Swaraj said she had earlier stated that some Bills have been moved in the US, but the government was taking steps so that they are not passed in such a form. She said the Foreign Secretary had met US Congress members who had been all praise for Indians.'OLD CONCERNS PACKAGED NEW' Even in 2012, a figure had come that 11.43 lakh migrants lived there, of whom 2.60 lakh were Indians. "We did not accept the figure because it cannot be considered authentic without thorough verification," she said.She said "there are no authentic figures on the number of undocumented Indian immigrants in the US", adding that the government provided travel documents only after the concerned person was conclusively identified as Indian."In case we don't provide travel documents, they would be jailed," Swaraj said, adding that from 2014 till date, 576 people have been provided travel documents.Responding to questions on social security, she said these issues have been raised in the past and can be taken up again later "as you say right now a sword is hanging on jobs".On H1B visas, she said there have been "flip-flops" in the past and the number of these visas rose from 65,000 to 1.95 lakh and then again went down to 65,000. "It is not that all these changes have happened only after the Trump administration has taken over," she said.
Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal promised on Saturday to abolish residential house tax in the Capital if his party is voted to power in the upcoming city civic polls.Kejriwal said the Aam Aadmi Party has worked out the mathematics and the money saved from corruption would be used to cover the shortfall after scrapping the house tax.Municipal elections in Delhi are due on April 23 and the AAP is contesting the polls for the first time. The usually city-centric exercise is witnessing the first-ever six-party contest with bitter fights expected in each of the 272 wards. The BJP holds all three municipal corporations in the city.?We had promised to halve power traffic and make water free in the assembly election and have fulfilled that. For the municipal election, we will do away with residential house tax. However, industrial and commercial house tax will be there,? said Arvind Kejriwal.Kejriwal said that his party had checked MCD account and the money could be saved by plugging corruption.?Public is harassed on the name of collection of house tax. We will end that harassment. We have seen councillors getting rich after winning the election because tax goes to their pocket. We have shown how money can be saved in construction of flyover, we can do the same in MCD also,? he added.Giving the example of the north MCD, Kejriwal said the body had a budget of R 3300 crore, out of which R 250-300 crore comes from house tax. ?This much amount can easily be saved,? he said. Kejriwal said that party would soon come up with a detailed manifesto for the municipal elections.
Lucknow, Mar 24 (PTI) Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Aditya Nath Yogi today directed the states top officials to chalk out clear guidelines for anti-Romeo squads so that there is no "unnecessary harassment" of boys and girls. In a meeting today, he also warned that in case of deaths due to drought and floods anywhere in the state, the concerned department officials will be held responsible. Giving specific instructions, the Chief Minister asked the principal secretary (home) to chalk out clear guidelines for anti-Romeo squads and "ensure there is no unnecessary harassment of boys and girls moving around or sitting at any place", an official statement said. He also asked for effective steps in cases of acid attacks. In the first meeting with ministers of state and senior officials of departments held by him, the chief minister also stressed on blanket ban on illegal mining saying that there were adverse reports about some districts. He said District Magistrates (DMs) and district police heads will be held directly responsible in case of illegal mining in their districts. Directing the officials to complete floods preparations in a transparent manner before June 15 without involving any middlemen, the chief minister warned that officials of the departments concerned will be held directly responsible for any loss of life due to drought or floods. 
At a time when public cynicism about the country's parliamentarians is at an all time high, there is one MP, who believes that the members of Parliament need to work much harder.He is Naresh Gujral, the Akali Dal MP in the Rajya Sabha. Gujral believes that Parliament needs to meet more often than it does now. Gujral has tabled a private member's Bill, the Parliament Enhancement of Productivity Bill, asking for Parliament to must meet at least for 100 days a year.The Bill could not have come at a more opportune moment. Adjournments are fast becoming a norm rather than an aberration. Complete sessions have been washed out without transacting any business inside the Houses and outside a Shiv Sena MP has made the news for beating up an Air India official.Gujral's Bill, if adopted by the government, could go some distance in not only making Parliament a lot more productive but it will also help redeem the MPs in the eye of the public.WHY THE BILL IS SIGNIFICANTIn addition to making it mandatory for Parliament to sit at least for a hundred days a year, spread over four sessions, it also calls for the convening of a special session of both houses for fifteen days. The special session as envisaged by Gujral will not have either the question hour or the zero hour but will be devoted exclusively to taking up two issues of utmost public importance. It has a provision for each political party submitting at least two issues before the business advisory committee that it wants to be taken up in the special session.Significantly at a time when both Houses of Parliament are routinely adjourned or unable to transact any business on account of disruptions. The bill has a provision for compensating the hours lost due to disruptions by adding it to the number of hours that the Houses must sit to make up for the disruptions. Gujral's Bill is silent on the need to deprive the MP's of their allowances on the days that the house is adjourned due to disruptions.
The Indian Medical Association (IMA) has called off doctor's strike in Maharashtra after a meeting with Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis. CM Fadnavis met IMA representatives at Vidhan Bhavan in Mumbai where they were briefed about the steps the government has taken to ensure the safety of doctors in hospitals.Doctors joined duty late at night, ANI reported early on Saturday morning.  Fadnavis told IMA representatives that more security has been provided in 16 hospitals since Thursday, and the government will make more arrangements in next 10 days.Fadnavis, who on Thursday appealed resident doctors to call off their strike, had said in the Assembly today that 'enough was enough' and that continuing the strike despite assurances was totally insensitive."Patients are suffering and people are getting annoyed. Attacks on doctors are wrong, but if despite the written assurances from the government they continue the strike they are being insensitive," he said."Enough is enough, we are willing to request them, but if they do not call off their strike, we will take legal action. Why shouldn't we? If they do not agree to the request, the government will not sit back with folded hands," he had added.Meanwhile, the Bombay High Court warned Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (MARD) that if they do not file an affidavit by 3 pm today, it will initiate contempt proceedings against the association's president and secretary.The court also reprimanded MARD and doctors for not complying with the orders and for not resuming their duties.Further, Advocate General Rohit Deo told the court that the state government will wait till 6 pm today for the doctors to resume work, and if they don't then action will be taken against them.MARD on the other hand, told the court that it will ask doctors to join work by 8 am tomorrow.

More than 20,000 resident doctors in the national capital on Thursday went on mass casual leave in solidarity with their Maharashtra counterparts, leading to postponement of over 800 surgeries across Delhi government and civic body-run hospitals, and also left thousands of patients in the lurch with OPD functions hit.Resident doctors in Delhi went on mass casual leave in solidarity with a similar move by their Maharashtra counterparts over rising cases of assault on doctors by patients? kin.According to hospital staff, due to resident doctors remaining absent from their duties the OPD registration counters were shut in several government hospitals after 10am, instead of the usual time 1pm, compelling patients to return.   ?At Lady Hardinge Medical College (LHMC) the OPD card counters were shut immediately after the resident doctors went off their duties as part of mass casual leave. Many patients had no idea initially and kept standing in the queue,? said Sanjana Rawat, a nurse at LHMC.There are 38 hospitals under the Delhi government. Resident doctors in hospitals under the central government, except the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, were also part of the protest. Delhi government hospitals every day witness nearly 1,600 pre-scheduled surgeries and over 200 emergency ones.Patients in several other government hospitals such as Lal Bahadur Sastri Hospital, Dadadev Mother and Child Hospital and GB Pant were affected as only the emergency departments were functional and even the normal medicine OPD remained partially operational.?Nearly 60 per cent of patients at Dadadev Mother and Child hospital could not get doctors consultation or treatment due to the protest. However, the emergency cases were somehow treated as resident doctors having duty in emergency department were not part of the protest,? said Nirupam Ghosh, associated with the administration wing of Dadadev Mother and Child hospital. Federation of Resident Doctors Association (FORDA) -- under whose banner the protest was being held in Delhi -- said of the 5,400 OPD cards registered in Delhi government hospitals on Thursday only 25 per cent of patients could consult doctors. The resident doctors have also threatened to go on a pan India strike soon if the government fails to ensure them a safe atmosphere to perform their duties. ?This mass casual leave was just an indication of what we can do to ensure our safety. If the health ministry does not take necessary steps to stop assault on doctors we will go on pan India strike,? said Pankaj Solanki, President FORDA, told IANS.Several private hospitals also came out in support of the protest by resident doctors.Sir Ganga Ram Hospital chairman DS Rana said that in solidarity with the ?concerns of safety of doctors? the general and private OPDs of the hospital will not function on Friday. The inpatient as well as emergency services will function normally.City-based Fortis condemned the rising cases of assault on doctors, but added the hospital will continue to function normally.?A safe and secure work environment is the basic requirement for care givers to provide best possible medical care to patients. We at Fortis Healthcare are firmly committed to our patients, and our medical services remain unhampered as our doctors continue to serve the community, as always,? a statement said.As part of the protest, resident doctors have also decided to sport black arm bands on March 24 during work.
India today reacted sharply to The New York Times editorial criticising Prime Minister Narendra Modis choice of Aditya Nath Yogi as the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, and said the papers wisdom to write such a piece was "questionable". "All editorials or opinions are subjective. This case is particularly so. The wisdom in doubting the verdicts of genuine democratic exercises, at home or abroad, is questionable," External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Gopal Baglay. The NYT in the highly critical editorial, titled Modi's Perilous Embrace of Hindu Extremists, said since he was elected in 2014, Modi has played a "cagey game, appeasing his party's hard-line Hindu base while promoting secular goals of development and economic growth".

Doctors believe that the boy could have a medical condition called "precocious puberty" which make the child attain puberty earlier in age.The identities of the young parents and the baby are being kept secret as per the POCSO Act. Reports, however, say that they have had a baby girl at a hospital in Ernakulam.The boy is being believed to be the youngest father in India.While some reports say that an 11-year-old boy from Auckland, New Zealand, is the world's youngest fathers, others give that title to 12-year-old Sean Stewart from Britain.Read more at FYI: You'll be shocked to know why pregnant Aussie teens are taking up smokingHer body, her right: Women have the right to decide on pregnancy, SC judge says
Three years ago, 11 Shiv Sena MPs created a ruckus at Delhi?s Maharashtra Sadan, where one of them force-fed a Muslim catering worker during the month of Ramzan. Among the MPs was Ravindra Gaikwad.The 56-year-old Gaikwad is in the eye of the storm again for beating up an Air India staffer after a Pune-Delhi flight landed at Indira Gandhi International Airport on Thursday morning. This incident, or the Maharashtra Sadan episode, was not Gaikwad?s first run-in with the law.As per his affidavit filed ahead of the 2014 General Elections, Gaikwad has three criminal cases against him. In the past, the Osmanabad MP has been booked for voluntarily causing hurt to deter a public servant from his duty, culpable homicide not amounting to murder, and criminal intimidation.As per the affidavit, one of the cases was registered in Tuljapur, Osmanabad on March 13, 2003, while two other cases were registered in Omerga, Osmanabad, on January 9, 2013.On Thursday, a defiant and unapologetic Gaikwad admitted that he hit 60-year-old Air India duty manager R Sukumar ?25 times? and has dared Air India to take action against him. ?It was not my fault, it (the AI?employee) was his fault. He should apologise. First ask him to apologise then we will see,? Gaikwad told mediapersons in Delhi on Friday.He has been summoned by Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray to Mumbai, even as the airline and other domestic carriers come together to demand a no-fly list for ?unruly passengers? such as him. The MP was upset because he had to shift from business class to economy after a change of aircraft.Senior Shiv Sena office bearers say that the MP is leaving Delhi at 7pm on Friday to meet Uddhav at his residence in Bandra.Three years ago, after the Maharashtra Sadan incident, Uddhav Thackeray had supported the MPs and no action was taken against them. A PIL filed in Delhi High Court to disqualify the 11 MPs was dismissed later.

Cinegoers are always in for a treat when two powerhouse performers like Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Irrfan come together. The two have acted together in films like Paan Singh Tomar and Lunchbox, but their relationship is strictly professional, Nawazuddin said. In an interview with Mumbai Mirror, where he was talking about his relationship with the Khans (Shah Rukh, Salman and Aamir), he was asked about Irrfan."I thought the fourth Khan we'd talk about would be Saif Ali Khan? Isn't he bigger? I have no equation or relationship with Irrfan. Mere acting ka alag tareeka hai... Uska apna alag tareeka hai (My acting style is different from his)," the Gangs Of Wasseypur actor replied. Reportedly, Nawazuddin and Irrfan stayed together in a one-room apartment when they were still struggling. However, they drifted apart once Irrfan rose to fame. Nawazuddin had told PTI in an earlier interview, "We were never friends earlier also and not now as well. We work together whenever we are cast in a film together." However, the actor rubbished rumours of a rift and said, "There is no rivalry with him. There is nothing like that. He is my senior and I respect him a lot."
Shahid Kapoor's adorable gestures for wife Mira Rajput make all other husbands look bad. He pampered her throughout her pregnancy, even going shopping for her because she was unwell. Speaking at the India Today Woman Summit 2017, Shahid said that he had an empathetic pregnancy when Mira was carrying Misha."It's nice to say 'we' were pregnant, because it gives you a sense of participation and responsibility," he said, adding that even though it was his wife who was in labour, he felt it too. "When she was in labour, I held my breath. At one point, I got dizzy and she whacked me and said, 'Why are you getting dizzy? I'm doing all the work here,'" he revealed.It is widely known that Shahid and Mira fell in love when she got pregnant. He explained, "Relationships are about experiences that you share together; that's how you fall in love. For me and Mira, Misha was our first project together. We felt a sense of togetherness and companionship." And if he hadn't fallen in love? The actor admitted that it was a very real possibility, but he was lucky that it did not happen to him or he "would be sitting somewhere in depression."The Haider actor also talked about how he could never really give up on smoking, until Mira came along. "I made a promise to my wife, so I quit smoking. She said 'You can't touch the baby if you smoke' and that was that," Shahid said.
Sushant Singh Rajput and Kriti Sanon, who were said to have been dating for about a year now, seem to have called it quits. If the grapevine is to be believed, the actors have finally broken up.A report in BollywoodLife quotes a source as saying that the couple has parted ways because of the differences that had cropped up between them. While Kriti had become too clingy for her own good, says the report, Sushant's mood swings and temperament were getting a bit difficult to deal with.Sanon and Rajput apparently realised that and have parted ways now.Over the last one year, even though gossip mills have never stopped churning out stories about their relationship, Sushant and Kriti have been extremely tight-lipped about their relationship. The two actors were on the sets of their upcoming film Raabta when Cupid struck. Sushant parted ways with his longtime girlfriend Ankita Lokhande right before diving into the relationship with Kriti Sanon. If reports from back then are anything to go by, it was Kriti Sanon's growing proximity to Sushant that led to the rift between Ankita and him.On February 14 this year, Sushant was at Karan Johar's Singles' Party too, leading many to deduce that the actor was indeed single.ALSO READ: Did Kriti Sanon dirty-dance with Sushant Singh Rajput?

Phillauri is a supernatural comedy where a man gets stuck with a friendly spirit after he is made to marry a tree. Here is our Phillauri movie review.Phillauri Cast: Anushka Sharma, Diljit Dosanjh, Suraj Sharma, Mehreen PirzadaPhillauri Direction: Anshai LalPhillauri Rating:  (1.5/5) When the friendly spirit Shashi is asked why she is stuck with the soon-to-be-married Kanan, she says, "Pata nahi, main to yahi atki hui hoon." Anshai Lal's 138-minute long Phillauri could speak for itself here.Once the one-line idea of guy-getting-married-to-spirit has been established, the film hovers around, like Shashi, from one useless scene to another which are neither funny nor interesting nor of any service to whatever goodness the film has.So, Kaneda-return Punjabi boy Kanan, 26, returns to India to get married. Cue: Boisterous Punjabi family scenes during wedding season. Kanan is played superbly by Life Of Pi actor Suraj Sharma. Kanan beat-boxes when he is asked to sing by his family. Later, he escapes them and goes to the roof to roll a J. When his fiance Anu (a decent Mehreen Pirzada) asks if he is ready for the marriage, he goes "Yo, chill." Phillauri is pretty entertaining and appears promising in these initial scenes till the point Kanan is married to a tree because of being a manglik and Shashi, the spirit enters his life.Now once this set up has been established, you need solid plot developments to fill the rest of the ninety minutes. This, Phillauri lacks. A premise like this has the potential to deliver a good supernatural comedy a la Beetlejuice or Casper. As such, the usual direction a story like this can take is one where the human(s) and the ghost(s) slowly resolve their innermost crises by being in constant proximity to each other and this is achieved by a series of good, well-written scenes.Now, Kanan's crisis is that 1. he is unsure of getting married and 2. there is a ghost living with him. Shashi's crisis is that she is stuck with Kanan; her story arc is resolved in the most predictable way at the end and it is strange that this was not made the film's focus from the very beginning. As long as Kanan and Shashi are together on screen, for the most part, Phillauri is interesting. In friendly-ghost films like these, it is the way the human and the ghost play off each other and the weird situations they create is what makes these films worth watching.But Kanan-Shashi's parts are punctuated by an elaborate backstory that is just dull and Diljit Dosanjh is a decent performer, sure, but he is not a big enough Khan to make mediocre writing worthwhile. The period-backstory involving Shashi and her lover, played by Diljit, seriously drags the film. Sometimes, the cloying sentimentality of these portions is nauseating and these scenes jut out like a sore thumb in the middle of the fun Kanan-Shashi moments.Phillauri's concept is good and novel. But the delivery is what North Indians call KLPD. The climactic payoff at the end comes way too easily. It's just lazy writing after a point. If only Shashi emerged in the writer's room before filming began and smacked some imagination into Anvita Dutt's head.(The writer tweets as @devarsighosh.)
A 22-year-old youth was arrested by the Greater Noida police on Thursday for allegedly posting objectionable content against newly elected Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on his Facebook wall.A complaint was lodged against accused Rahat Khan by members of the Hindu Yuva Vahini, a youth group founded by Adityanath, in Dankaur police station on Thursday evening.Acting on the complaint, the police nabbed Khan, who runs a Jan Suvidha Kendra (public utility center) in Dankaur.?Rahat Khan has posted morphed image of the newly elected chief minister and captioned it with ?Yogi hai, ya bhogi hai? on his Facebook wall,? said Rajpal Tomar, the station house officer of Dankaur police station.Police said Khan was arrested under Sections 66A (Punishment for sending offensive messages through communication service) of IT Act.Khan?s mother Munni, however, claimed that her son was innocent and was framed.?Our family is involved in several social service activities. We have even won applauds from Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself for raising the issue of triple talaq,? she said.She added that Khan had been framed by the land mafia, who stole his Facebook password, logged in and posted the content online.The action came close on the heels of four people getting arrested in Uttar Pradesh for allegedly posting and sharing on social media ?objectionable pictures? of Adityanath. These arrests were made in Varanasi, neighbouring Ghazipur, Sonbhadra and Bareilly districts, police said. The 44-year-old Adityanath, known as a ?firebrand Hindu leader?, is the head priest of Gorakhpur?s influential Gorakhnath shrine. The controversial leader is a five-term parliamentarian for Gorakhpur.
A woman hailing from Queensland, Australia, must have tried to get some rest after sending her five-year-old daughter to school, but when do mothers get to rest?She received a concerned call from the school informing that her daughter had packed a Smirnoff raspberry vodka in her lunchbox. Earlier in the day, the mother had asked her little one to grab a pack of juice from the freezer but instead of juice, the 5-year-old grabbed vodka.?The mother realised the blunder but thankfully she did not get in trouble since the teachers assumed it was a genuine mistake of a five-year-old.Embarrassed and simultaneously realising the hilarity of the incident, the woman made a Facebook post about it, calling it an EPIC LUNCHBOX FAIL."EPIC lunchbox fail?¦when you tell your five-year-old Preppie to put a frozen juice pouch in her lunchbox and you forget the other pouches in your freezer!""I apologised for not sending enough for the teachers and they just laughed thankfully," she wrote, according to a Daily Dot report.

Jamat-ud-Dawa acting chief Hafiz Abdul Rehman Makki on Thursday said that Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif celebrated Hindu festival 'Holi' to please the Indian government."The prime minister and other ruling elite celebrated Holi festival to please the Indian government. The rulers must realise that Muslims and Hindus are two separate nations. Their culture and civilisation are different. They cannot live together," Makki, who is the brother-in-law of Mumbai attack mastermind Hafiz Saeed, said at a conference here.Makki said the rulers are weakening Pakistan's ideology for extending hand of friendship with India."We will defend Pakistan's ideology and will make nation strong to fight the enemy," Maki said.NAWAZ SHARIF RECEIVES IRESharif participated in a function in Karachi to celebrate the Holi festival with the Hindu community.In his message to minorities, Sharif warned against the forced conversion and destruction of worship places of other religions, describing them as "crime in Islam".Earlier, cleric Allama Ashraf Jalali, secretary general of Sunni Ittehad Council, said that the Prime Minister had not only blasphemed against Islam but also demeaned the "ideological foundations" of Pakistan by participating the function.Issuing a fatwa against Sharif the cleric demanded "an open apology from the premier for violation of his oath."

The man who was caught on CCTV camera wearing women's underwear and lurking near a girls' hostel has finally been caught.The police found a trunk full of women's clothing at his residence.The 35-year-old, Abu Taleem is a employee of the Bangalore Turf Club and stays close to the Maharani college, he visited often.The accused would scale the boundary wall of the college and use a fence to hoist himself up.The police during their investigation suspected that Taleem would enter through the wall between the Bangalore Turf Club and the college hostel. So, they began questioning people. After rounding off nearly all the Bangalore Turf Club employees who were living close to the premises in sheds, the police identified a few individuals who looked like the suspect in the CCTV footage.During the questioning, the police found out that one of the men has a very peculiar behaviour and that there were complaints that he would slip out in the idle of the night .Finally, the police identified Abu Taleem who confessed that he would wear the undergarments and later discard them only to go around stealing more.Taleem had devised quite a strategy to go about his obsession. He would wait for the other labourers to go to sleep. After which, he would powder his face and apply oil on his arms to allow him to slip faster in case he gets caught.Now that the pervert has been caught, the girls in the hostel can heave a sigh of relief. 
There is an open bar in the Delhi University, and it?s absolutely free!Poor tipplers in North Campus have been using ?neem beer? from a local tree for the past four months to stay high and hydrated. Several people, mostly labourers working in the university, queue up with containers near the freak neem tree for their daily fix. They like it better than off-the-shelf liquor; moreover, it comes free.?A neem tree has been secreting a white liquid since November 2016. It smells of toddy (naturally alcoholic sap of palm) and tastes somewhat bitter. But people from the campus and outside collect it to drink. They say it is intoxicating,? said Mahesh Prasad, the head gardener of North Campus.There are around 15 neem trees near the rugby stadium towards the back end of the campus, most of which are more than 50 years old. But only one tree is giving out the sap ? at least 10 litres a day.?This is unusual. It is for the first time that we have witnessed anything of this sort in Delhi,? said CR Babu, professor emeritus at Centre for Environmental Management of Degraded Ecosystems (CEMDE) in Delhi University.Like any watering hole, it?s easy to locate the inebriating tree. The strong beer-like scent can be smelled at least 10 feet, or even more, from the tree. The charade of bottles, buckets and pitchers is also a good enough sign.?I had two to three glasses of the toddy. It was quite intoxicating. I didn?t fall ill after that. As it is a neem tree, I think, it also has some medicinal properties,? said a labourer, in high spirits.Someone has also placed a ladder and tied a bucket right at the source. Not a drop to be wasted.?The liquid was coming out from near a joint of two branches. But then, it stopped and started to come out from a different place. The flow is gradually slowing down. The smell is also becoming weaker,? said Vikrant Goswami, a scientific assistant at CEMDE.Scientists from the university?s department of environmental studies are testing ? in the laboratory ? samples of the liquid.?We suspect it is not the kind of toddy which we usually get from palm trees. There is some kind of microbial activity going on inside the tree. The microbe is helping the tree sap to ferment,? said Dr David Kothamasi, assistant professor at the department.It would take at least a month for the test results to be available. In the lab, too, the bottle in which the toddy has been capped started to inflate when its cap was sealed. That?s a signal that the fermentation process has not stopped. Scientists said a similar incident was reported in Varanasi a few years ago. Tests revealed the presence of salicyclic acid, a key ingredient in aspirin.The evergreen neem is the magic tree of Ayurvedic medicine, and is called sarva roga nivarini or the one that prevents and cures all diseases. The one at DU is keeping the spirits high.
Delhi Police on Wednesday rescued a woman and her daughter, who had been living locked up in their house for the last four years,  in southwest Delhi?s Mahavir Enclave. Police said they were found malnourished and living in unhygienic conditions. The woman?s elderly father-in-law lives in the same house. The matter came to light when a resident of A-block at Mahavir Enclave-II reported the matter to a local media channel and the police. He claimed that the two women - Kalavati (42) and her daughter Deepa (20) - were forcefully locked up in a first-floor room at a house nearby.  However, when the police went to their house, the women told them that they were living inside out of choice. The police have now referred the two women to IHBAS (Institute of Human Behavior and Allied Sciences).?Clearly their mental condition is unstable. They are undernourished and both weigh not more than 25 kg. We have referred them to IBHAS and will oversee the treatment,? an official said.According to the woman?s father-in-law, Mahaveer Mishra, Kalavati and Deepa had locked themselves up in the room since his sons? death in a road accident in 2013. Mishra?s wife had passed away in 2000.Police officials said Mishra stayed in the next room and gave them food once a day whenever they asked for it. When the police tried to take them to the hospital on Wednesday, they refused to step out. The police, however, took help of a counselor to convince them after which they were taken to DDU?hospital in Hari Nagar for treatment. They say the two women were hallucinating. ?The woman often claimed to have been speaking to her husband and went on without food for days during these bouts. In his statement, the elderly man said that he has been getting them treated by a local doctor, as he did not have enough savings to take them to a hospital,? an official said. Mishra was a linesman retired from the MTNL and gets a monthly pension of Rs 16,000.?He said that the women hardly ate in the last four years and never stepped out of the house. He also said that whenever he took them to the doctor, they refused to tell their symptoms to the doctor because of which they could not be treated,? he added.
From Lalit K Jha Washington, Mar 23 (PTI) If India lowers the 100 per cent tariffs imposed on the popular American Harley Davidson motorcycles it could result in more foreign investments in the country, a top White House trade official has argued. "If India agrees to lower its tariffs on Harley Davidson motorcycles, Indian consumers will buy more Harleys and save less while Harley will sell more Harleys and invest more," Peter Navarro, Director of White House National Trade Council, said in a letter to the editor to The Wall Street Journal. "Truly fair and reciprocal trade between the US and its trading partners, rather than the perpetual turn of the screw we receive now, will lead to a thousand similar kinds of adjustments as our bilateral trade deficits fall and savings and investment patterns adjust," Navarro added in the letter published yesterday. He wrote the letter in response to the debate that his op-ed piece on March 6 in the daily had generated. He had argued that if the US uses leverage as the worlds largest market to "persuade" India to reduce its "notoriously high tariffs" America will surely sell more Harleys there. India imposes a 100-per cent import duty on the Amercian motorbikes, popular for a customisation that gave rise to the chopper-style motorcycles. 
Shahid Kapoor and Kangana Ranaut's cold war has crossed all possible contours of normalcy and has probably crossed over to the bizarre now. The film that Shahid and Kangana starred in and which was the beginning of all the drama, Rangoon, has sunk into oblivion. But trust the actors to not let sleeping dogs lie.After repeated jibes from Kangana regarding his 'mood swings' and behaviour on the sets of Rangoon, now Shahid Kapoor has spoken out about it all.In an interview with Filmfare, when Shahid was asked about Kangana saying that it was difficult to kiss him with his thick moustache in Rangoon, the Kaminey actor said, "Kangana has a thing for one-liners. I'm not one of those. I'd rather focus on the movie. I like positivity. We shared a professional equation. So, I was also surprised by the comments. I also read some retractions she made later that she didn't mean it in a bad way."During the promotions of Rangoon, when IndiaToday.in asked Shahid about any 'incidents' during the shoot of the Vishal Bhardwaj-directed film, Shahid had denied it all with a curt, "No, no incidents on this movie."However, Kangana Ranaut would beg to differ. From talking about how on certain days Shahid would treat her like she was a 'suicide bomber' to his severe mood swings, Kangana bared it all to filmmaker and talk-show host Karan Johar on KJo's show.Shahid went on to tell the magazine, "When actors start engaging in this table-tennis match through interviews, which the media feeds off, the focus is then on the actors and not the film. I don't believe in publicising a film or myself through this kind of activity."The fights sure made Rangoon more the talking point than what it normally would have been.
Bollywood actor Kangana Ranaut is surely one talented woman. After wooing the heart of the nation with her epic performance in 'Queen', the actor is now reportedly all set to make her directorial debut.Ms Ranaut who has returned from the New York Film Academy where she completed a two month course on screenplay writing, seems to be in no mood for wasting time. After having recently produced and directed a short feature film called The Touch, she now has a chick flick on her mind.It has also been added that Kangana will be taking a lot of inspiration from her personal experiences and will not venture into the business of remakes.
Yogi Adityanath, the new Uttar Pradesh chief minister, made a surprise visit to the Hazratganj police station in Lucknow.Following an inspection of the police station, Yogi Adityanath said police should be people-friendly and steps will be taken to maintain law and order in the state.During the 30-minute inspection, DGP Javeed Ahmad, IG Satish Ganesh and SSP Manzil Saini were present.Yogi Adityanath visited the mahila (woman's) police station, the local police station and the circle officer's chamber during the inspection. The BJP fought the election in Uttar Pradesh on the development plank and promised to improve the law and order situation in the state.THE THREE ISSUES YOGI ADITYANATH DISCUSSED:#Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said women police officers should be provided better accommodation facilities. He also asked the department to prepare a plan to recruit more women in the police.#He asked for better relationship between the citizens and the police force. The issues he stressed on: there should be seating facility for those visiting the police station; police should be cordial to people; clean drinking water should be available at all police stations.#He also discussed the growing menace of cyber crime with the department and asked for more focus on the cyber crime cell.OTHER MAJOR DECISION OF THE CHIEF MINISTER: Yogi Adityanath, in less than a week since assuming office, has taken several big decisions in line with the promises made by the party in its election manifesto.The chief minister ordered the state police to form anti-Romeo squads to check eve-teasing. These squads, to be deputed near schools and colleges, are carrying out awareness drives across cities. In Lucknow zone, the IG will monitor these squads.Yogi Adityanath also ordered a blanket ban on cow smuggling and said zero tolerance would be exercised against offenders. This in in addition to the government's crackdown on illegal slaughterhouses--the BJP had promised to close illegal slaughterhouses in the state in its election manifesto. Since Yogi Adityanath took oath as the chief minister on March 19, several illegal slaughterhouses have been sealed in Meerut, Ghaziabad, Allahabad among other places.On Wednesday, the Uttar Pradesh chief minister banned consumption of gutkha, pan masala in state government offices. While visiting the old CM's office in Lucknow, Yogi Adityanath was furious to see paan stains all over the office.On Tuesday, Yogi Adityanath met Union Tourism Minister Mahesh Sharma and is learnt to have discussed the construction of a huge Ramayana museum in Ayodhya. The Centre has already allocated a fund of Rs 154 crore for the ambitious project.ALSO READ:Romeos must die: On Yogi Adityanath's orders, UP police forms squads to crack down on eve-teasers ?
Scientists have developed a new genetic test for Alzheimer?s risk that can be used to predict the age at which a person will develop the disease.A high score on the test, which is based on 31 genetic markers, can translate to being diagnosed many years earlier than those with a low-risk genetic profile, the study found. Those ranked in the top 10% in terms of risk were more than three times as likely to develop Alzheimer?s during the course of the study, and did so more than a decade before those who ranked in the lowest 10%.Rahul Desikan, of the University of California ? who led the international effort, said the test could be used to calculate any individual?s risk of developing Alzheimer?s that year.?That is, if you don?t already have dementia, what is your yearly risk for AD onset, based on your age and genetic information,? he said.The so-called polygenic hazard score test was developed using genetic data from more than 70,000 individuals, including patients with Alzheimer?s disease and healthy elderly people.It is already known that genetics plays a powerful role in Alzheimer?s. Around a quarter of patients have a strong family history of the disease, and scientists have shown this is partly explained by a gene called ApoE, which comes in three versions, and is known to have a powerful influence on the risk of getting the most common late-onset type of Alzheimer?s. One version of ApoE appears to reduce risk by up to 40%, while those with two copies (one from each parent) of the high-risk version can increase risk by 12 times.The latest study takes a new approach, showing that, aside from ApoE, there are thousands of background genetic variations that each have a tiny influence on Alzheimer?s risk, but whose cumulative influence is substantial.The researchers first identified nearly 2,000 single letter differences in the genetic code (known as SNPs) and, after ranking them for influence, developed a test based on 31 of the markers. The test was then used to accurately predict an individual?s risk of getting the disease in an independent patient cohort.In people with the high-risk version of ApoE, those ranked in the top 10% of risk on the new test got Alzheimer?s at an average age of 84 years, compared with 95 years for those ranked in the lowest 10%.James Pickett, head of research at Alzheimer?s Society, said: ?Preventing the development of dementia symptoms is the holy grail of Alzheimer?s research but to succeed we first need accurate methods to predict who is most likely to develop the condition. This study?s approach was fairly successful at predicting the likelihood of someone developing dementia over the coming year, but needs to be tested further in mixed, non-US populations.? Pickett added that, while the score could help to identify people for trials, it was too early to apply it as a genetic testing tool for use in the clinic.Rosa Sancho, head of research at Alzheimer?s Research UK, said that while genetic makeup can influence the chances of developing dementia, a healthy diet, regular physical activity and remaining mentally active can also drive down the risk. ?Genetics is only part of the story and we know that lifestyle factors also influence our risk of developing Alzheimer?s,? she said. ?The best current evidence points to habits we can all adopt to help lower our risk and indicates that what?s good for your heart is also good for the brain.?The findings are published in the journal PLOS Medicine.
Navjot Singh Sidhu's ministry will have to be changed if he wants to continue working in TV, Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh said today. Sidhu, who has been given the responsibility of the culture ministry, had earlier said that he would continue his television work and that there was no conflict of interest in doing so."If it's permissible then we have no issue otherwise he has Culture Ministry and we may have to change his portfolio," Amarinder Singh said. The controversy over Sidhu's appearance as a celebrity-judge on the hugely popular television show -?The Kapil Sharma Show - erupted after Punjab CM Amarinder Singh told India Today that he would seek legal opinion over Sidhu continuing his TV work even after becoming a minister.On Tuesday, Sidhu said he respects Amarinder and will follow his orders but added that there was no conflict of interest in him appearing on TV."Whatever Captain Amarinder Singh said, the boss is always right. But I want to tell you that the term office of profit only implies to a post held under government office. BJP MP and actor Kirron Kher works for television. I have quit IPL and nearly 70 to 80 per cent?television assignments. I perform the government duties between 9 am to 6 pm. If I go anywhere after 6 pm and return by 9 am whatever I do at night should not be the business of anybody. Nobody should evince interest in it," Navjot Singh Sidhu had said.  Sidhu, who was believed to be a front runner for the post of deputy chief minister, was given a rather lightweight department to look after. He was?made minister of tourism and culture, and local bodies in the new Congress government in Punjab.WATCH: Navjot Singh Sidhu: TV job isn't office of profitALSO READ:
Agitating doctors in Maharashtra have been asked to resume work by 8 pm today or risk losing six months' worth of salary, state minister for medical education Girish Mahajan said today. Over 4,000 resident doctors across Maharashtra have gone on mass leave, agitating against dangerous working conditions. The protest was sparked by an incident last week when the relatives of a deceased patient beat up a resident doctor at Mumbai's Sion Hospital.Addressing the issue behind the agitation, Mahajan said, "The government will provide 500 guards too civic-run hospitals within five days, 600 guards within 20 days and 1,100 guards within a month."  Earlier today, the Birhanmumbai Municipal Corporation issued a notice on the matter, asking 500 resident doctors in Mumbai to resume work or face disciplinary action. The notice warned the doctors that if they fail to resume work, then they could be expelled and their medical registrations could be canceled, as per a January 31, 1996 Government Resolution.Meanwhile, the Indian Medical Association's Maharashtra chapter has lent its support to the physicians, expressing 'deep pain' at the "recent spate of events of unabated violence against doctors."A letter signed by IMA Maharashtra State's president Dr Ashok Tambe and honorary state secretary Dr Parthiv Sanghvi says, "We are unable to understand the apathy on the part of the government in not providing an atmosphere free from fear.""We oppose any action taken against resident doctors and will work to all extents to ensure that they are not victimised."Dr Sagar, an advisor to the IMA, said they don't want assurances but actual on-the-ground action. "We need more security at OPDs, in emergency wards and operation theaters," he added. 
Forced to drink acid by her former boyfriend in south Delhi?s Sangam Vihar on Wednesday morning, a 19-year-old woman was left hospitalised with a burnt throat and face.Having received around 20 per cent burns, the woman, Muskan (name changed), is undergoing treatment in the emergency ward of AIIMS. She is expected to survive even as the doctors are yet to find out the extent of damage to her internal organs.The man made her drink acid near her house. Her parents said no one in the neighbourhood came to her rescue. The alleged attacker, 22-year-old Ravi Kumar, managed to escape from the spot after the crime, but surrendered at Sangam Vihar police station, said Romil Baaniya, DCP (South-East). Kumar told the police that he was angry as he suspected Muskan to be in a relationship with someone else. He also feared that her family was set to engage her to someone else.The woman, the sole bread earner of her family, works at a footwear manufacturing unit in Sangam Vihar. She lives with her mother and two siblings. Ravi lives two lanes away and works as a tailor.?Ravi and my daughter were in a relationship for almost two years. I had agreed to their marriage but Ravi?s parents were against it because of difference in our castes,? said Muskan?s mother.When Muskan realised that the marriage was nearly impossible, she severed the relationship around last Diwali. But Ravi could not get over it and kept visiting her.?To keep Ravi away, my daughter recently lied to him that she had entered in a relationship with someone else. After that, Ravi would object to my daughter speaking to anyone over the phone,? the mother alleged. For the last one week, Ravi had allegedly been confronting Muskan in the street close to her home when she would walk to her workplace. Around 10.15pm on Wednesday, he again confronted Muskan about her telephonic conversations, but this time he was armed with a bottle of ?diluted acid?. ?When she warned him to keep away, Ravi opened the acid bottle and without any warning tried to force the liquid down my daughter?s throat. Some of it went down to her stomach while the rest covered her face,? alleged the mother.?No one tried to help my daughter. She managed to return home and collapsed in my lap. She tried to use signs to tell me that the acid had entered her stomach,? said the mother who too received minor burns to her hands because of the acid on her daughter?s body.Police were informed and the woman rushed to AIIMS. Even as a police team was searching for Ravi, he visited the Sangam Vihar police station and confessed to his crime. ?He has told he could not bear to see the victim speak to anyone else or get married elsewhere. He wanted to leave her in a situation where no one would marry her,? said an investigator. 
Superstar Rajinikanth's 2.0 landed itself in a fresh controversy when two photojournalists were allegedly manhandled by the crew members of the film.Now, director Shankar himself had visited Press Council office in Chennai to sought an apology. He said, "I am sorry. I shall ensure incidents like this don't repeat. It has happened without my knowledge."According to reports, journalists have withdrawn a complaint filed against the film's production manager, a bouncer and Shankar's nephew.It all started when Ranganathan, a photojournalist, had questioned the crew members for shooting on broad daylight, when the permission was given only between 11pm and 6am. On the other hand, a bouncer had assaulted Sri Bharath, another photojournalist, on his face and alleged that he only tried to snatch the camera. The crew left immediately after the media came in for the rescue.After the ruckus, the police have detained Pappu, an assistant director of 2.0.Made on a lavish budget of Rs 400 crore, the film stars superstar Rajinikanth, Bollywood actor Akshay Kumar, Amy Jackson and Sudhanshu Pandey.Produced by Lyca Productions, the film is slated to release on Diwali this year.
A young man has been caught trying to smuggle more than 1,000 diamonds into Shenzhen City from neighbouring Hong Kong by hiding them in his shoes.Customs officials in Shenzhen in Guangdong province found 212.9 carats of diamonds in the alleged smuggler's insoles when he passed through Luohu port, which links Hong Kong with inland cities, reports Xinhua."The man was suspicious as he sometimes tiptoed. When he found that we were looking at him, he quickly shifted to normal walking posture," said a customs officer Wang.Customs officers asked the man to take off his shoes. When they removed his insoles, they found several bags of sparkling diamonds.According to customs at Luohu port, diamonds have been found in the socks and snack food packages of other smugglers. A few days earlier, a man tried to sneak 1,554 diamonds weighing 164 carats in packaged snack food.FYI || Cutting horns, removing thorns: Czech zoo decides to saw off horns of rhinos to protect them from poachers ||

Shirish Kunder is famous for going out on a limb and attracting trolls on Twitter. More or less, that is. This time around, the filmmaker invited the wrath of a certain section of Twitter for his comments on Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath.When Yogi Adityanath was announced as the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, writer Chetan Bhagat tweeted, "#YogiAdityanath as UP CM. Because when you make the naughtiest guy in class the class monitor, he behaves the best."Shirish Kunder's tweets on the UP Chief Minister were probably in response to Bhagat's 'logic'.In the now-deleted tweets, Kunder wrote, "Hoping a goon will stop rioting once he's allowed to rule is like expecting a rapist to stop raping once he's allowed to rape."And the next tweet read, "Going by the logic of making a goon as CM so that he behaves, Dawood can be CBI director. And Mallya - RBI Governor."Even though Yogi Adityanath's appointment as the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh has raised several eyebrows, Shirish Kunder's tweets were not spared. The Joker director was burnt on the micro-blogging platform for his anti-Yogi tweets. And for the uninitiated, Kunder has more often than not been roasted on Twitter for his views on politics.

A CCTV footage has emerged showing a person driving a WagonR ruthlessly crushing two puppies playing on the roadside in Vasant Kunj. The incident took place when the puppies were sitting on the roadside with their mother. In the video, the driver can be seen waiting at a distance while the puppies are playing towards the side of the street. While there was enough space for the car to pass by, the driver chose to turn left and drive straight towards the puppies.The driver drove over the puppies, crushing one of them to death and injuring the leg of the other. The dog, on seeing her puppies being crushed under the wheels, barked and chased the car helplessly but the driver did not stop or slow-down the car to check on the bleeding puppy.NO ACTION TAKEN EVEN 48 HOURS AFTER COMPLAINTThe heart-wrenching video was captured in the CCTV cameras of Sector B, Pocket 5 and 6 of Vasant Kunj. Some Good Samaritans, who had been feeding these puppies in the colony, filed a complaint at the Vasant Kunj North Police Station."Dogs in our colony have been poisoned several times in the past as well so it has not come as a surprise that the puppies have been crushed to death by one of the residents here. We had approached the police and filed a complaint but it has been over two days and no action has been taken yet," said the Good Samaritan, who does not wish to be named. "Running down or poisoning an animal is a direct violation of sections 428 and 429 of the IPC which require an FIR to be filed immediately. Even after two days of the complaint and repeated calls to the Vasant Kunj North police station regarding the case, no action has been taken," said Tarun Sarin, a volunteer with Dhyan Foundation, an animal rights NGO.ALSO READ| ?When man bites a dog: Delhi resident chops off puppy's legs with hacksaw

Pakistan's new ODI and T20 captain Sarfaraz Ahmad avoided speaking on the PSL spot-fixing scandal, which has rocked the cricket community, but admitted that the country's cricket was going through tough times.Terming the coming series in the West Indies as a big challenge for Pakistan cricket, the wicketkeeper-batsman told the media on the eve of the team's departure for the Caribbean that the first target was to win the three match ODI series and qualify directly for the next World Cup."I don't want to comment on the PSL issue but yes we are going through tough times and we need to do well in the coming series to boost our people," he said.He conceded that like in 2010 Pakistan cricket team would again have to do a lot to overcome the recent scandal, which has led to the suspension of five players.During the tour of England in 2010, three players - then captain Salman Butt, Mohammad Asif and Mohammad Aamir - were found involved in spot-fixing and banned for five-years.Sarfaraz had earlier said that Pakistan would miss the services of opener Sharjeel Khan in the West Indies as he was suspended in connection with the spot-fixing scandal.Head coach Mickey Arthur said while the PSL scandal and the involvement of his players was disappointing, one had to move on.

The Delhi high court on Tuesday sought the Centre?s reply on a contempt plea alleging the government failed to act against political parties, including the Congress and BJP, for allegedly accepting donations from foreign companies despite a 2014 court direction.On March 28, 2014, the high court had ordered the Election Commission (EC) and the home ministry to look into the accounts of the Congress and BJP for traces of foreign funds and take action within six months.The court had found both parties flouting the norms of the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCR) by accepting donations from Indian subsidiaries of UK-based Vedanta Resources. Section four of the FCR Act prohibits a political party or legislator from accepting foreign contributions.Read | Foreign funding: Congress to clarify on FCRA amendment in Supreme CourtJustice Manmohan issued show cause notice to home secretary of government of India on the contempt moved filed by NGO Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR).

Rex Tillerson has said he did not want to be US secretary of state and only took the job because his wife convinced him to do it.The former ExxonMobil oil executive revealed his initial reluctance in an interview published after a controversial trip to Asia and hours before the biggest event of his two months at the state department, an international meeting on Wednesday about how to fight Islamic State (Isis).  ?I didn?t want this job. I didn?t seek this job,? Tillerson told the Independent Journal Review (IJR), in an interview conducted on his official plane during the three-nation Asia trip. ?My wife told me I?m supposed to do this.?He said he had not met Donald Trump before being summoned to Trump Tower after the surprise election victory, ostensibly to talk to the president-elect ?about the world? and his experiences as an oil company CEO.?When he asked me at the end of that conversation to be secretary of state, I was stunned,? he said, adding that at 65 years old, at the end of a four-decade career at ExxonMobil, he had expected to retire: ?I was going to go to the ranch to be with my grandkids.?However, he said that when he returned to his Texas home after meeting Trump in New York, his wife, Renda St Clair, shook her finger in his face and said: ?I told you God?s not through with you.?He said he now feels his wife had been right: ?I?m supposed to do this.?Not everyone shares that view. Tillerson has been the subject of heavy criticism since taking the post as the country?s top diplomat at the beginning of February. He was left out of the loop of several critical foreign policy decisions made in the administration?s early days, most importantly the travel ban for refugees and visitors from a list of Muslim countries.He has also almost totally dodged the press for the first few weeks in his job. He did not take the Washington diplomatic press corps with him on his Asia tour, breaking with decades-old practice. The sole exception was the journalist from the IJR, a little-known outlet founded by a former Republican operative. The initial explanation from the state department was that he wanted to save money and take a smaller plane than usual. In his interview, Tillerson repeated that explanation but also suggested it would be his policy to avoid the press until and unless he had a specific message to deliver.He told the IJR: ?I?m not a big media press access person. I personally don?t need it. I understand it?s important to get the message of what we?re doing out, but I also think there?s only a purpose in getting the message out when there?s something to be done.?When questioned about Russia, the IJR reported: ?He was so cagey ? his answer wasn?t even worthy of inclusion.?Tillerson has also been criticised for failing to defend the state department vocally enough in the face of a threatened budget cut of up to a third. Senior Republicans have said the cuts to diplomacy and foreign aid proposed by the White House would not pass Congress. In his remarks to the IJR, however, Tillerson appeared to relish the management challenge of cutting down the size of the US diplomatic establishment.?Looking at ongoing conflicts, if we accept that we?re just going to continue to never solve any of these conflicts, then the budget should stay at the current level,? he said. He said he had not yet talked to Trump about what a pared-down state department would look like or how it will be staffed: ?We haven?t gotten that far yet.?While in South Korea, Tillerson was reported in the Seoul press to have snubbed the government by telling Korean officials he was too tired to dine with them. In response, he accused his hosts of being deliberately misleading. ?They never invited us for dinner, then at the last minute they realised that optically it wasn?t playing very well in public for them, so they put out a statement that we didn?t have dinner because I was tired,? he told the IJR. On Tuesday, the state department was fighting off a new controversy, after it emerged Tillerson would skip what would have been his first Nato foreign ministers? meeting in early April in Brussels so he could be in Florida for Trump?s first meeting with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping. The state department spokesman, Mark Toner, insisted the administration was 100% committed to Nato and that Tillerson would be meeting many member foreign ministers at the anti-Isis meeting in Washington on Wednesday. Toner said the state department had proposed new dates for a possible Nato meeting.
Former Australian captain Ian Chappell feels India have run out of ideas to dismiss Steve Smith in the ongoing Test series against the men from down under. Smith is the highest scorer in the four-match series. The Australian captain has amassed 378 runs including two hundreds in three Tests so far. Also watch: Cheteshwar Pujara is definitely India's wall: Michael Clarke to India TodayThe 27-year-old Smith outshone all of India's batsmen with a startling hundred on a difficult Pune pitch and then hammered an unbeaten 178 in Ranchi to blunt a potent Indian bowling attack. (Ranchi Test: Australia hold on for draw, series-decider in Dharamsala)Chappell felt it was apparent India's bowlers "are no closer to unlocking the secret to upending Smith." "Smith was already a successful batting captain, but on this tour of India he has taken his play to another level," Chappell wrote in his column for ESPNcricinfo. "He's made two centuries in three Tests, and following his undefeated vigil in Ranchi, it's apparent India's bowlers are no closer to unlocking the secret to upending him. They may have run out of ideas. Smith's patience and thirst for runs is never-ending." "Smith has reduced his mental errors to a minimum. He has eradicated much of the risk from his play but he still puts away the bad or even slightly wayward delivery. (Steve Smith says Peter Handscomb, Shaun Marsh repaid his faith)India has been a nightmare for the best batsmen in the world in recent years.

Biopics seems to be the thing with Bollywood. And Kangana Ranaut is the next in line to begun shooting for a biopic. It's been two years since Kangana was working on a script with director Ketan Mehta. The two had collaborated for a film on Rani Laxmibai. But the latest buzz has Kangana will shooting for the biopic on her 30th birthday, but with another director. According to a report in Mid-Day, Kangana and Ketan have fallen out, and the actor has chosen another director for the biopic. If report is to be believed, Mehta wanted to shoot his film in English as he wanted the biopic to have a global appeal. But Kangana, who also worked on the script, had a different opinion. A source was quoted as telling the daily, "Ketan was insistent that his movie be made in English for an international audience, like Gurinder Chadha's The Viceroy House, but those working on the film felt it won't go with the ethos of the story. The actress and the filmmaker couldn't find common ground on the language factor, leaving the project in a limbo."But come Thursday, and Kangana will shoot for the first poster of Manikarnika. With Kangana out of out Ketan's film, she has joined hands with director Krish of Gabbar Is Back fame for the biopic. The story has been written by KV Vijayendra Prasad, writer of Baahubali and Bajrangi Bhaijaan. "The new film will be helmed by a fresh team. A top studio, too, has agreed to back the venture, which is envisioned as an action-packed, feisty film. It is the biopic of an ordinary girl, who when faced with tough times, discovered the warrior in her. The film will go on floors in mid-May," added the source. 
BJP MLA Brijesh Singh's posters thanking voters for the recent astounding victory have created a stir in the Saharanpur district of Uttar Pradesh after they named Deoband as Deovrind. While Deoband is known for its historical significance and Darul Uloom Deoband has been a centre of Islamic learning since the Mughal era, Brijesh Singh had demanded that the city be renamed Deovrind after BJP came into power. "I have no such intention that can connect it to any Islamic institution. All I want is to rename Deoband to Deovrind. It is all about development", said Singh when asked about the posters.Singh's supporters too articulated his demand to rename Mughal structures."We not only want Deoband to be renamed as Deovrind, but also want all those places to be renamed which were once under the Mughal rule. We want this to be done under the BJP government," said VHP leader Vikas Tyagi. However, the MLA's move has not gone down well with the Muslim community that forms a sizeable part of the population in Deoband, which is one of the five constituencies in the district."It doesn't matter even if you change the name a thousand times. Deoband will always be known because of Darul Uloom," said Maulana Arshad Madani, president of Jamat Ulema-E-Hind.Due to the eminence of Darul Uloom, Deoband sees an influx of students who come here in pursuit of Islamic learning. The BJP MLA's claims have visibly irked the students too. FOR WHOSE SAKE? "Is renaming Deoband the country's biggest issue? Will it aid in development anyway? Can this improve roads and provide better education?" asked a student. Posters have been put up in different parts of Deoband. Singh, in his defence, had earlier said that the region has been extant since the time of Mahabharata. According to him, even the Pandavas worshipped here.  Singh said that it was in Deoband where Yaksha asked crucial questions to Yudhishthir.?Places like Rankhandi Jakhwala and Jadoda Panda bear testimony to Deoband's historical connections, he added.Deoband has voted BJP to power after 21 years. Singh had defeated BSP's Majid Ali and SP's Mavia Ali by 1, 02,244 votes.Watch | UP: BJP MLA renames Deoband as Deovrind in posters, irks Muslim population 
Lucknow, Mar 21 (PTI) The Uttar Pradesh police today issued orders to constitute "anti-Romeo squad" in 11 districts of the Lucknow zone to prevent eve-teasing, as BJP had promised during the Assembly polls in its sankalp patra. "In a bid to check incidents of eve-teasing and passing of comments on them (women and girls), anti-romeo dal would be constituted at the police station levels and action under Goonda Act taken against wrongdoers," IG (Lucknow Zone) A Satish Ganesh said. The Lucknow zone comprises 11 districts adjoining the state capital. The IGs order said that attempts should be made to check cow slaughter and cattle smuggling effectively and those involved should be booked. 
Coimbatore, Mar 21 (PTI) The RSS today expressed concern over the growing Jehadi activities and the declining Hindu population in West Bengal and and urged the people to create awareness against the state governments communal politics. It also accused the Mamata Banerjee government of giving encouragement to the anti-national elements due to its Muslim vote bank politics. A resolution adopted at the three-day meeting of the Akhil Bharatiya Pratinidhi Sabha (ABPS), the RSS top policy making body, also condemned the extremist violence. "This (decline in Hindu population in West Bengal) is a matter of serious concern to the unity and integrity of the country," RSS Joint General Secretary Dattatreya Hosabale told reporters briefing about the deliberations at the meeting. The resolution said the ABPS strongly "condemns the violence by extremists and the Muslim appeasement policy of the state government and calls upon the countrymen to create awareness against the Jehadi violence and the communal politics of the state government." Hosabale said after partition, the Hindus from East Pakistan were forced to seek refuge in West Bengal. It was not surprising that due to such large influx, the Hindu population in the state, which constituted 78.45 per cent in 1951 had declined to 70.54 per cent as per the 2011 census, he said. The meeting also calls upon the state government to rise above "petty vote-bank politics" and discharge its constitutional obligations, he said. Hosable urged the Centre to ensure firm action against the anti-national jehadi elements within the state in the interest of national security. 
More than 28,000 children aged less than six years have died in Madhya Pradesh in the past one year due to malnourishment and diseases resulting from it.The state women and child welfare department while accepting that children died because of disease resulting from malnourishment refuses to attribute even a single death to malnourishment.Women and child welfare department minister Archana Chitnis read out an answer to a question raised by Ram Niwas Rawat of the Congress in the ongoing budget session of the Assembly in which she accepted that 28948 children had died in the state in the past one year. And though malnourishment related deaths have been reported from across the state she refused to attribute even a single death to malnourishment."Technically It is impossible to answer how many children died because of malnourishment because children died because of various disease which could have resulted from malnourishment. But I can tell you as far as malnourishment figures are concerned we have improved on all parameters," Archana Chitnis said while talking to India Today.Children have died across the state but we chose to do a reality check in Satna where according to the minister's reply 2167 children below the age of 6 have died due to various reasons. Majhagava block is the worst affected where around 1000 malnourished kids who have been admitted to the rehabilitation centres set up by the government. Many deaths have been reported from the 19 odd tribal dominated villages that fall in this block but the government is not willing to accept malnourishment and severe malnourishment as the cause.Leader of opposition Ajay Singh however attributes corruption as the cause behind the rising deaths of infants in Madhya Pradesh. "Satna is there, also Chitrakoot is there and in Majhgava block there is severe malnourishment. The reason behind this is corruption. Those who are supposed to supply nutritional food are associated with the BJP and till the time this cartel is broken malnourishment cannot be tackled in Madhya Pradesh," he told India Today.If we break down the annual death figure of 28948 into days a shocking statistic stares at your face. 79 children aged below six years die every day in Madhya Pradesh and this shows that the infant mortality rate in Madhya Pradesh is worse than even many African nations. Whatever may be the cause the government has some serious thinking to do.
New Delhi, Mar 22 (PTI) Private sector lender Axis Bank today said its MD & CEO Shikha Sharma is not resigning. "..The news appearing in section of social media stating the impending resignation of the MD & CEO of the Bank, which please note is false, speculative and is being circulated with the mala fide intention of misleading the investors and the general public," Axis Bank said in a clarification to the BSE.

Starting April 1, passengers will be able to avail the opportunity of travelling in Rajdhani or Shatabdi trains even if they had booked tickets in other mail/express trains for the same destinations. Railways is launching a new scheme from April as part of which wait-listed passengers can get confirmed accommodation in the next alternative train if they opt for the same while booking their tickets. As per the scheme, there will be no extra charges taken from passengers or any refund provided for the difference of fare. Known as Vikalp, the alternative train accommodation scheme aims to utilise vacant berths in many premier trains including Rajdhani, Shatabdi, Duronto and other special service such as Suvidha trains in all major routes. Railways has to forego about Rs 7,500 crore in a year in refund to customers for cancellation of tickets for various reasons. MOVEPASSENGER-FRIENDLY: RAILWAY OFFICIAL Describing the scheme as a "passenger-friendly" move to provide confirmed accommodation to wait-listed passengers in alternative trains, a senior Railway Ministry official said, "We aim to achieve the twin objectives of providing confirmed accommodation to wait-listed passengers and ensure optimal utilisation of available accommodation by this scheme." After the introduction of flexi-fare system in premier trains, some berths are going vacant while at the same time many passengers could not be accommodated in other Mail/Express trains due to the huge demand. "In any case, these berths are running vacant. So whatever we can save in refund is going to be a neat save for us. No additional cost is involved to railways so anything we save will be earnings for railways," the official added. Currently, railways is running the scheme on six routes including Delhi-Lucknow, Delhi-Jammu and Delhi-Mumbai sectors since November 1 on a pilot basis. SYSTEM AVAILABLE FOR ONLINE TICKETINGThe system is available for online ticketing now but it will be extended to over-the-counter sale also as the required software is being readied for the purpose. As per the scheme, wait-listed passengers of a train would be given the option of getting a confirmed accommodation in the next train running on the route. While there is a huge demand for train berths in certain sectors round the year, some routes witness increased rush during festive seasons. If a passenger opts for the Vikalp scheme while booking tickets, he will get an SMS alert on his/her mobile phone about getting the confirmed accommodation in the alternative train. The name of the passenger who has been provided accommodation in the alternative train will not figure in the wait-listed charts of their original train, the official said, adding that a separate list of passengers transferred in the alternative train will be pasted along with the confirmed and wait-list charts.(WITH INPUTS FROM PTI)

Bombay High Court today came down heavily on over 4,500 resident doctors of Maharashtra who had gone on mass leave since March 20. The court was hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed against the strike due to which many patients are not receiving proper treatment.Advocate Datta Mane, representing the petitioners, told the court that since Monday morning 58 people have died in the state. Although Chief Justice Chellur did not believe this situation was due to the strike but the government pleader, appearing for the state government, told the court that the health care in civic and state-run hospitals was paralysed due to 60 per cent of its workforce not reporting to work.Advocate Prashant Pophale appearing for the Maharashtra Association for Resident Doctors (MARD) pointed out that there have been three incidents wherein patients' relatives have beaten up doctors in Dhule, Mumbai (Sion Hospital) and Nashik in the last few days.WHY THE PUBLIC ANARCHY, ASKS CHIEF JUSTICE CHELLUR Chief Justice Chellur asked, "Why the public anarchy? It's madness," before asking the state pleader to explain the reason for the such action taken by the patients' relatives. She added, "I don't say doctors don't commit mistakes but, there are complications due to which patients lose their life. Every case cannot be due to negligence. And even if there is negligence there are redressal forums for it."Pophale pointed out to the court that the doctors are not on strike but only on mass leave and as an association, they have been telling the doctors not to do so. He, however, added that the state has done little to protect the doctors. But Chief Justice Chellur was of the opinion that the resident doctors cannot put the public at large in trouble. "If you (resident doctors) think being a doctor you can behave like a factory worker, then you are unfit to serve as a doctor. It's a shame. How can you (resident doctors) say first provide security only then we will work?" asked Chief Justice Chellur.NEXT HEARING TOMORROWWith this, the Bombay High Court ordered the striking resident doctors to join work or face action by the management. It said that the management is free to initiate action and contempt proceedings against the striking doctors. The next hearing of the case is on March 22.After the Bombay High Court issued the order, Naresh Kabra, a resident doctor at Sion Hospital present at the hearing, said, "We are not super humans either. Patients verbally abuse us almost every day but we don't say anything. It's only when we are physically beaten up that we have protested. Why cannot the state protect us?" Kabra pointed out that after subsequent court orders, 58 CCTV cameras were installed at Sion Hospital but the audit report shows that only eight are functional.
After sweeping the civic polls in Maharashtra and almost snatching Mumbai from the Shiv Sena, the BJP has now set its sights on the Delhi municipal corporation. The Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) polls are scheduled to take place on April 22, and the BJP, which has been ruling the MCD for over a decade, has planned an aggressive campaign to take on its rivals.Besides the Congress, the BJP will also face challenge from Arvind Kejriwal's the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) which is contesting the MCD polls for the first time. A total of 272 seats in North, South and East Delhi Municipal Corporation are up for grabs in the election. BJP's CAMPAIGN PLAN FOR MCD POLLSLast week, BJP President Amit Shah appointed a team of five senior leaders to oversee and supervise the poll campaign. The team includes Vinay Sahasrabuddhe, Jitendra Singh, Nirmala Sitharaman, Sanjeev Balyan and Shyam Jaju. "We are going all out for the MCD polls and have set a very high target for ourselves. Our triumphs in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand have given a fresh impetus to our workers and volunteers and to add to that strength, we are bringing in big faces as well," a BJP source said.Prominent among the big faces are Amit Shah and Union minister M Venkaiah Naidu who are likely to address a convention of polling booth in-charges at the Ramlila Maidan on March 25. BJP's Delhi chief Manoj Tiwari was quoted by a Hindustan Times report as saying that he will invite Prime Minister Narendra Modi to address a rally in the national capital.The party has also roped in Bhojpuri film star Ravi Kishen to woo the Poorvanchalis (Bihar and eastern Uttar Pradesh), who form a bulk of voters in Delhi.The Phogat sisters, Geeta and Babita, too will campaign for the BJP in the run up to the MCD polls, while talks with cricketer Shikhar Dhawan are yet to be finalised. BEYOND STAR CAMPAIGNS, WHAT IS BJP PLANNINGThe BJP's rule at the MCD has been tarred by allegations of nepotism and rampant corruption by its councillors. To project a fresh, corruption-free face ahead of the MCD polls, Manoj Tiwari recently announced that the party will not field a single sitting councillor or his/her relative for the upcoming election.The decision took senior BJP councillors in Delhi by surprise but was believed to have the approval of the party's highest leadership. "Zero-tolerance towards corruption, which is Prime Minister Narendra Modi's style of functioning, has to be our mantra in all party matters, including distribution of tickets," Manoj Tiwari said, while brushing off talks of discontentment in the party. "We are not bothered about the feelings of sitting councillors. We are answerable only to the public, not to the councillors," he said.Such sweeping decision in the BJP before the MCD polls comes in the wake of both the Congress and the AAP targeting the BJP-run MCD for corruption. AAP chief and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has repeatedly attacked the MCD for having failed to implement Narendra Modi's flagship cleanliness drive on the ground. He called the MCD "a den of corruption" which doesn't even "issue a death certificate without a bribe."ALSO READ:

Left-arm spinner Ravindra Jadeja on Tuesday became only the third Indian in history to climb to the top of the ICC rankings for Test bowlers but his rise to the top comes as no surprise to former Indian captain Sourav Ganguly. (WATCH: Team India lands in Dharamsala for series finale)Speaking to India Today, Ganguly had himself rated Jadeja ahead of Ashwin in the current series, even before his form was reflected in the ICC rankings."If you look at this series and the series against England he has just started to come out of the shadow of Ravi Ashwin. Ashwin has 250 Test wickets, ahead of everyone, and is the fastest to the mark, but Jadeja in this series has taken the responsibility. In this series he has gone ahead of Ashwin as far as taking responsibility is concerned," Ganguly told India Today.ICC RANKING FOR TEST BOWLERS:Jadeja claimed nine wickets in Ranchi to take his tally to 21 in the series, four more than Ashwin while the left arm spinner also has a better strike rate and average. His efforts drew high praise from Indian captain Virat Kohli after the drawn third Test."Jadeja's bowling was outstanding in this match. Every bowler bowled well but according to me Jadeja stands out. For this pitch he bowled exceptionally well and showed why he has joined Ashwin as the world's best bowler", said the India captain, who posted a picture of himself with the 'bowling machine' on route to the series decider.No doubt Kohli will depend on the deadly duo of Jadeja and Ashwin to seal a record extending seventh straight series win.Off to Dharamshala for the last one. With the bowling machine ??ï¸???????@imjadejapic.twitter.com/OAG8Kgh57BGanguly believes that Jadeja is in the form of his life but can get even better."The last 6 months have been the best for Jadeja as a spinner over the last 4-5 years, hopefully he can carry on, and he is getting the experience. He has played a lot of Test cricket now and hopefully he can use that experience to get better. It is bound to happen when you have been around for 4-5 years and you know you are going to play Test matches. Jadeja has been backed by MS Dhoni, he has been backed by selectors and has been backed by Virat Kohli so he has everything going for him and he has bowled well," Ganguly said. (Australian media compares Kohli to Trump)BEST AVG AT HOME IN TESTS (100+ WKTS):Former Aussie skipper Michael Clarke too hailed Jadeja for his heroics in the Ranchi Test that ended in a draw.
Actor Salman Khan once again proved to be the Sultan of Bollywood by paying the highest advance tax after beating Akshay Kumar and Hrithik Roshan in the financial year 2016-17. But the one who has surprised the Income Tax (IT) department is comedian-actor Kapil Sharma, whose income has shot up by almost 206 per cent in just one year.Indiatoday.in has an exclusive data of advance tax paid by top ten actors till March 15, 2017 which clearly shows that Salman Khan is the highest paid actor in the Indian film industry. However the department declined to give the advance tax numbers of Shah Rukh Khan, Amitabh Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, as all three of them are under investigation linked to Panama Papers leak case.

Two Sufi clerics of the Hazrat Nizamuddin Dargah in Delhi, who had gone missing in Pakistan last week, blamed a Pakistani newspaper for publishing a misleading article that had led to their ordeal. The duo arrived at the Indira Gandhi International Airport on Monday and went to pay obeisance at the shrine where they spoke to media. They are scheduled to meet external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj at  2pm. Syed Asif Nizami, 82, and Nazim Ali Nizami, 66, are members of the family of the Sajjada Nashin (hereditary administrators) of the shrine. Officials of home ministry met the two clerics after they returned to Delhi on Monday.

Parvez Sultan (@theparvezsultan) March 20, 2017On Saturday, Swaraj had spoken to Pakistan Prime Minister?s adviser on foreign affairs, Sartaj Aziz, regarding the case. Later in the day, Pakistan conveyed to India that the two missing clerics had been ?traced? and that they had reached Karachi. On Sunday, external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj spoke to them. ?I just spoke to Syed Nazim Ali Nizami in Karachi. He told me that they are safe and will be back in Delhi tomorrow (Monday),? she said in a tweet.According to media reports in Pakistan, the clerics had been in ?interior Sindh where there was no communication network? and thus could not inform their relatives about their whereabouts.Earlier, Pakistani sources had said the two clerics were in the custody of Pakistan?s intelligence agency over their alleged links with the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM).The clerics were offloaded from Karachi-bound Shaheen Airlines on March 14 at the Allama Iqbal International Airport, Lahore, sources claimed. 
The Indian cricket team on Tuesday landed in Dharamsala for the fourth and final Test of the series against Australia, starting Saturday.India have boosted their pace battery by adding Mohammed Shami into the squad. Kohli had earlier said Shami remains in the scheme of things for the last Test."We sent him to play (Vijay Hazare), wanted to give him match practice. I've not spoken to selectors but all kinds of possibility approaching the next Test," Kohli said.The four-match series currently stands 1-1 after Australia stunned India by 333 runs in the opening Test in Pune before Kohli's men bounced back beautifully to win the second Test in Bengaluru by 75 runs to level the series. The third Test in Ranchi ended in a draw after Peter Handscomb and Shaun Marsh saved Australia blushes.Australia will just have to draw the final Test to retain the Border-Gavaskar trophy after their 2-0 victory in 2014. Kohli had won six consecutive series before the Australia. Pressure will be on India as their home domination is under threat.
 A 51-year-old alleged member of the Khalistan Commando Force (KCF) was arrested on Monday from south Delhi?s Mahipalpur. A country-made pistol and four cartridges were allegedly found on him.Police said the arrested man, Gursewak Singh aka Babla, was reportedly in the process of establishing KCF?s base in Delhi with the help of some gangs of autolifters and robbers. By committing bank and ATM robberies in Delhi, Rajasthan, Punjab and Haryana with the Delhi?s criminals, Babla was reportedly planning to raise funds to carry out terror activities in Delhi and Punjab, police said.?Babla was under pressure from his handler, KCF chief Paramjeet Singh Panjwar, to strike against India and revive their outfit?s presence in Delhi and Punjab. Panjwar is presently based in Pakistan and running anti-India activities allegedly with Pakistan?s intelligence agency ISI?s help,? said a crime branch officer. Praveer Ranjan, joint commissioner of police (crime branch), said Babla was a close aide of Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, who was killed 1984 by the Army in Operation Blue Star. Babla has spent more than 26 years, half of his life, in various jails in different cases, said the joint CP.Police claimed he was previously involved in over 50 cases of terrorist activities, murder of police officials and police informers, and dacoities and robberies in police stations, banks, shops in Punjab, Delhi, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh during the Punjab insurgency in the 1980s. Ranjan said that Babla was wanted by the special cell, Delhi Police?s anti-terror squad, in a case when he had escaped from the custody of the Punjab police while being produced at the Tis Hazari Court in Delhi in 2004. ?A case was registered at the Subzi Mandi police station and the probe was handed over to the special cell. Babla was wanted by us (Delhi Police) in that case and the court had declared him a proclaimed offender,? said Ranjan, adding he had escaped again from Punjab police custody at Bhilwara railway station in Rajasthan in 1986.According to the joint CP, Babla?s arrest came following information that he would come to Mahipalpur area to meet some criminals with whom he was planning to commit bank and ATM robberies in the city. ?Our team laid a trap and caught Babla from near Shiv Murti on NH-8 with a pistol and four rounds,? Ranjan said adding Babla was also in touch with Jagtar Singh Hawara and other top leaders of Sikh militant groups who are lodged in different jails.A native of Ludhiana in Punjab, DCP Bhisham Singh said, Babla joined Bhindranwale-led militant group in 1982, almost two years after his elder brother Swaran Singh became a militant. 
Tibetan religious leader Dalai Lama today warned that the global terrorist crisis is fast reaching the nuclear threshold. He said that people of both India and China are great; it is only the politicians who cause problems.?He was addressing a gathering at the Karshni Mahotsava in Mathura after which he headed to Agra. Talking to India Today about the question raised by China on his Arunachal Pradesh visit, Dalai Lama said he goes there to spread the message of peace and co-existence and China can come and see what he preaches there. He added, "If China considers Arunachal Pradesh as a part of its country, then it should also consider Kashmir a part of India."Dalai Lama reached Mathura on March 20 where he visited the Leelasthali of Lord Krishna and his childhood consort Radha. The spiritual leader also visited the Raman Reti Ashram, where a religious programme was organised.Commenting on the political changes in several countries recently, including the United States, the Dalai Lama said that change is the universal truth, but only the change that takes place in the hearts of the people. "Political changes are petty issues, whereas the rise of maturity in the people of India and China are the most important factors that will shape the world's future," the leader said.NO DISPUTE BETWEEN BUDDHISM AND HINDUISMHe expressed grief on the global spread of violence in the name of religious and sectarian differences and said, "These problems have been created by the people and only they can solve them through a firm resolve". 
Sanjay Dutt, who is currently busy shooting for his comeback film Bhoomi in Agra, was injured on the sets yesterday. The actor got injured during a fight sequence in Chambal, for the climax of the film, where he had to fight with a group of 19-20 men.Sanjay was injured during a jump gone wrong, and even though the pain aggravated through the day, he continued shooting. When the doctors conducted an X-ray post the shoot, it was confirmed that the actor had a hairline rib fracture.Even though Sanjay has been advised to rest, he has continued shooting, taking rest only during breaks.Producer Sandeep Singh said, "We were shooting the climax scene in the Chambal ravines and Sanjay was in an action sequence when he hurt himself in the rib cage. He must have been in a lot of pain, but he did not stop. Later when we went to the doctor, the X-ray showed a hairline fracture. We wanted to stop the shoot, but Baba insisted. Really commendable on his part."Producer Bhushan Kumar added, "We really appreciate that Sanjay has been shooting non-stop despite the excruciating pain that he must be in. He is truly a phenomenal person and actor." Bhoomi, directed by Omung Kumar, revolves around a father-daughter relationship. Aditi Rao Hydari plays Sanjay Dutt's daughter and the titular character. Sanjay was last seen in a guest appearance in Rajkumar Hirani's satirical film PK.
The Australian media has made a scathing accusation on India captain Virat Kohli of being "completely untouchable" and "a law unto himself". The Daily Telegraph compared Kohli to the United States President Donald Trump, saying "Kohli has become the Donald Trump of world sport".This comes after Kohli accused the Australian players of trolling Team India physio Patrick Farhart during the Ranchi Test."They (four-five of them) started taking Patrick's name. I don't know why. He's our physio. His job is to treat me. I don't find the reason behind it. I could not understand. You must ask why they have started taking his name," Kohli said. While saving a run on the first day of the third Test, Kohli hurt his right shoulder and Farhart rushed onto the field to attain to his injury. Kohli eventually left the field with the physio and was back in action only on the third day.Later, Glenn Maxwell was seen mocking Kohli's injury when he imitated his action by clutching his right shoulder after his dive to save a boundary. The Indian skipper, too, gave it back with a similar gesture when David Warner got out in Australia's second innings.However, Smith insisted that they never disrespected Farhart, who himself is an Australian."Virat was having a go at me out in the middle and saying how I was disrespecting Patrick Farhart when actually it was the exact opposite. If I was to do anything, (I was inferring) he did a pretty terrific job to get Virat back on the field after that shoulder," Smith said.DRS SAGAThe Kohli-Smith quarrel started in Bengaluru over a DRS incident when the Australian captain was caught seeking help from his team's dressing room over a review after he was trapped leg before by Umesh Yadav.While Smith called it a "brain fade", Kohli warned the visitors of "crossing the line". International Cricket Council put an end to the saga by not pressing charges against Smith or Kohli."Test captains, under the rules of the game, are supposed to be the flagbearers for upholding the spirit of the game, yet the ICC has allowed the Indian captain to destroy one of the foundations on which the game has been played for more than a century," The Daily Telegraph wrote."The fact Kohli has not been sanctioned for calling the Australians systematic cheats or his latest unfounded attack on Smith shows that he is completely untouchable.""The ICC won't fine him. Not even the BCCI, who through their broadcaster apologised to Smith, can get their skipper to tow the party line."'KOHLI DISRESPECTS GAME'The report further compared Kohli to Arjuna Ranatunga for showing no respect to his opponent."Like former Sri Lankan captain Arjuna Ranatunga, Kohli relies on a flagrant disrespect of his opponents and the game to fuel himself and his team.Soft cricketing administrators have given rise to a bat-wielding Trump."'KOHLI, AUSTRALIA'S NO.1 ENEMY'There's no doubt that Australian fans hate Kohli. India and Australia contests have always seen sparks flying, be it "Monkeygate" or Ricky Ponting playing an umpire on the field or Kohli's finger gesture to the Sydney crowd during his first tour Down Under.
The ongoing four-Test series between India and Australia has been acrimonious with players from both sides trading verbal blows but Australian pacer Mitchell Starc's latest comments could send relations between the two teams spiralling down further. (Johnson, Warne take a dig at Virat Kohli's Team India after Ranchi draw)Also watch:Cheteshwar Pujara is definitely India's wall: Michael Clarke to India TodayThe injury-prone Starc had to return home after Australia were crushed in Bengaluru as India drew level following a heavy defeat in Pune. But the left-arm pacer, far from the maddening action in India, did not want to miss out on the banter and sledging that has dominated the series and took a nasty dig at star India off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin, promising to hit him on the head when he next visited Australia. (Inability to bowl us out will be hurting India, says Steven Smith)"I look forward to bowling to Ashwin in Australia. (I might) take his advice and hit him on the badge," Starc was quoted as saying by cricket.com.au. (Steve Smith says Peter Handscomb, Shaun Marsh repaid his faith)Starc's insensitive comments come on the back of a cheeky response by Ashwin, who had rubbed his forehead with a forefinger after dismissing the Aussie all-rounder during the visitors' failed run-chase at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium. (Virat Kohli alleges Australia of disrespecting team physio Patrick Farhart)As Australia stuttered and stumbled in their 188-run chase on a tricky Bengaluru pitch in the second Test, Ashwin, who had rocked the visitors with three wickets before tea, snuffed out the dangerous Starc. As part of the celebrations, Ashwin rubbed his forehead with his index finger. (Sunil Gavaskar says Virat Kohli missed a trick in Ranchi)For those of you wondering why Ashwin did that, here's a recap of what happened in India's second innings. Starc was bowling a fiery spell on Sunday and Abhinav Mukund was in the firing line. As it happened, a top-edge off his bat flew over his head for a six. It was then that Starc rubbed his forehead with his index finger.Ashwin was clearly standing up for a teammate and added insult to Starc's injury after a crucial blow. While India's players have been matured enough to leave the onfield rivalry behind, Starc's latest comments could pave the way for another controversy. In 2014, Australian batsman Phil Hughes was killed after being hit on the head by a bouncer. Ever since, there have been serious concerns after batsmen have copped blows on their headgear. Starc, in retrospection, might be embarrassed with his words. Australia, the pioneers of mental disintegration, have been clearly rattled by India's onslaught over the last two decades. In 2014, the likes of David Warner and Steve Smith were involved in some heated moments with Indian cricketers before Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma responded in kind. 
Congress state President Raj Babbar today spotted a poster announcing a reward of Rs 5 lakh to the person who finds political strategist Prashant Kishor and presents him before the party workers. The posters were removed immediately.According to reports, the missing poster was put up by secretary in the Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee Rajesh Singh, who however denied them. He has now been suspended.Kishor has been facing criticism since the party lost in the recently-ended Uttar Pradesh elections. He was handpicked by Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra to manage the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections. Reports suggest that Kishor was the one to suggest the Congress-Samajwadi Party alliance. 
Anupam Kher is known to have voiced his opinions on a series of issues, from the Kashmir unrest to demonetisation. Call it a "political opinion," and he corrects you - "It's my national opinion. My opinions are about my country. They are not representative of any political ideology. It's a very cliched thing to call any opinion about the country a political opinion."Many people believe that actors should stay away from talking about anything unrelated to films. In fact, if an actor has an opinion, especially one that is not popular, they get trolled. Kher tells IndiaToday.in, in an exclusive interview, "Acting is a part of my life, it's not my life. I'm an individual; I'm a citizen of this country, I'm a teacher, I'm a motivational speaker, I'm a writer, I'm a son. Just because everyone may not agree with me, doesn't mean I'll stop putting forth what I want to say. In life, you cannot make everyone happy. And you don't necessarily stop talking to those who don't agree with you. You have to, as a celebrity, learn the art of ignoring. Yes, of course, you get upset and unhappy sometimes. But it's alright, I have been in this business for a long time."While B-Towners from Shah Rukh Khan to Aamir Khan had expressed their concern that India was becoming increasingly intolerant, Anupam Kher had begged to differ. But when Sanjay Leela Bhansali is thrashed and his Padmavati sets are attacked for allegedly distorting the glorious Rajput history, does it not smack of intolerance? The actor says that "it is very unfortunate," but not does think intolerance is the reason."I think the media gives it great importance. The problem is that if a bunch of 10 people doing something like this gets nationally covered, then they know that this is how they will get noticed... But on a level of what they have done, it's absolutely not right. It should not have happened. Nobody can dictate what should be made and what should not be made," he emphasises.Anupam Kher, who was the censor chief from 2003-04, also said that the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) rules need to be revisited. "The rules were written in 1952. The present government had appointed a committee headed by Shyam Benegal. I don't know what happened to the recommendations. They need to be implemented. Rules toh ban jaate hai, unko implement nahi kiya jaata," the actor said.Anupam Kher will be seen next in Naam Shabana, which is scheduled to release on March 31. The film also stars Taapsee Pannu, Akshay Kumar and Manoj Bajpayee. 
If you've never had the time to think as to why passports around the world come in the limited colours that they do, allow us to enlighten you today. Shades of red, green, blue and black are the four colours that dominate the universe of passports--and not without good reason. As per a report by Business Insider a certain Hrant Boghossian has some reasons to attribute to the choice of passport colours. The Vice President of Marketing at Arton Capital--a firm that headlines "interactive passport database, Passport Index," believes that while essentially the colours are limited, nations experiment with the hues of these four primary shades that can be attributed to "many possible scenarios."Here's a breakdown of things.Blue: Countries whose passports are blue in colour are believed to belong to the so-called 'new-world' league of nations. These nations include India, North America, South America, Australia among others. Red: Considered to be the colour of the communist movement worldwide, red generally belongs to countries that have had a communist history or are still under its influence. China, Serbia, Latvia among others are examples. 
State Bank of India (SBI), which will see five associate banks merge into it on April 1, has decided to shut down almost half the offices of these banks, including the head offices of three of them. This process will start from April 24."Out of the five head offices of the associate banks, we will retain only two. Three head offices of the associate banks will be unbound along with 27 zonal offices, 81 regional offices and 11 network offices of the associate banks," SBI Managing Director Dinesh Kumar Khara told IANS in an interview."We will keep their structure in place till April 24 and, post that, we will start dismantling the associate banks' controlling offices, which includes head offices, regional offices, zonal offices and network offices," Khara said.LIST OF ASSOCIATE BANKSThe five associate banks that will merge with SBI are: SBBJ (State Bank of Bikaner and Jaipur), SBM (State Bank of Mysore), SBT (State Bank of Travancore), SBP (State Bank of Patiala) and SBH (State Bank of Hyderabad).SBI is India's largest bank with assets of Rs 30.72 lakh crore and figures at No. 64 in the global ranking of banks (as of December 2015; December 2016 ranking is still awaited). Post-merger, with assets of approximately Rs 40 lakh crore, it will be among the top 50 banks in the world. SBI Chief Economist Soumya Kanti Ghosh told IANS that, post-merger, the bank will be at No. 45.The shut-down move is to avoid overlapping offices in the same area and "we intend to remove any kind of duplicacy in the controlling structure", Khara said.The five associate banks will cease to exist as legal entities and become a part of SBI from April 1, but the various merger processes will start only after April 24, once the balance sheets of the five entities are audited and added.MANAGING DIRECTOR's VIEW"We will have to get the balance sheets of the associate banks audited a day prior to the merger, that is, on March 31. The balance sheets of the banks will be drawn up and added; it takes 15-20 days. Soon after the audit is done, the branches will be completely merged with SBI," Khara told IANS.There are currently 550 SBI offices while its associate banks have 259. The target for the number of controlling offices after the merger is 687 -- a reduction of 122 offices.Employees directly affected by these shutdowns -- estimated at 1,107 -- will be redeployed, mostly in customer-interface operations, Khara said."The net result is that people in controlling functions will be available for deployment on the ground for improving reach to the consumer," he said."There are about 5-7 people in every regional office and 20-odd people in each zonal office. One regional office controls 30-40 branches, while 4-5 regional offices are controlled by one zonal office," he told IANS.The associate banks have also offered a Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS) to employees who do not wish to relocate. "VRS is only an option, else they will be relocated. They will have a different role," he said.OTHER MERGER PROCESSES TO SOON COME INTO EFFECT TOOAlong with the winding-up of these offices, a number of merger processes will come into effect simultaneously, including the data merger of the five entities."Data merger will also start from April 24 and we will finish it by May end. That is the plan of action," he said, adding that the bank had given itself six months to complete all merger-related processes."I would rather say that within a quarter all the things should be in order. Ideally, we would like to have it in one quarter, but it will not spill over beyond the second quarter," Khara said.
The BJP's decision to appoint Yogi Aditynath as the Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh has invited a range of reactions from its political rivals, with some slamming the choice yet others adopting a wait-and-watch approach.In a scenario like this, newly-anointed CM Yogi Adityanath has found support from an unusual quarter. Samajwadi Party leader and former chief minister Akhilesh Yadav's uncle Ram Gopal Yadav said one should give Yogi Adityanath at least six months to start work and deliver on the BJP's promises to people in Uttar Pradesh."There is no need to start attacking him from the first day," said Ram Gopal Yadav as Gorakhpur MP Adityanath spent his first day in the chief minister's office today.WHAT RAM GOPAL YADAV HAD TO SAY ABOUT ADITYANATHRajya Sabha MP Ram Gopal Yadav, who helped nephew Akhilesh Yadav dethrone father Mulayam Singh Yadav from the SP president's post, said there was nothing objectionable in Yogi Adityanath holding a puja at his house before moving in."Doing puja is a normal practice in Hindu tradition before starting on a new project," Ram Gopal Yadav said, reacting to reports on Yogi Adityanath getting a team of seven priests from Gorakhpur to perform puja at the CM's official residence at 5, Kalidas Marg in Lucknow.The Samajwadi Party leader also lauded Adityanath's directive to his ministers to declare their source of income and assets to the party and the chief minister's office within 15 days. FINGER-POINTING STARTS IN SAMAJWADI PARTYFollowing the Samajwadi Party's humiliating loss in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly election, finger pointing has begun and Ram Gopal Yadav could face some tough questions from party seniors. Samajwadi Party patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav was never in the favour of an alliance with the Congress and did not campaign for it during the election. However, once the election results were announced, father Mulayam Singh had defended son Akhilesh and said the responsibility for the defeat should not entirely fall on the young Yadav's shoulders.As father and son try to put up a united face after election, many expect the party to take some tough decisions to put the house in order.

External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj once again turned a saviour for an Indian woman married in Pakistan after her father's YouTube SOS that his daughter was being mistreated by her in-laws in Pakistan. Swaraj on Monday said that the Indian High Commission had met the woman in Pakistan and was ensuring her safety and return to India.The external affairs minister posted on Twitter that she received a YouTube message from Mohammad Akbar about his daughter Mohammadia Begum who was being ill-treated by her in-laws.She tweeted, "Our mission sent a Note Verbale requesting the safety, security and well-being of Mohammadia Begum." "Our High Commission officials met Mohammadia Begum and she expressed her desire to return to India."As the Hyderabad woman's passport had expired last year, Swaraj asked the Indian High Commission to renew her Indian passport and facilitate her return to India.Meanwhile, Mohammedi Begum (the name on her passport) spoke to her mother Hajara Begum over phone and informed that her husband Muhammad Younis beat her up and locked her in a room after Indian High Commission officials met her.ILL-TREATED BY IN-LAWS The 44-year-old broke down while narrating the ill-treatment at the hands of her husband and in-laws. The mother advised her to have patience and wait for the help from the High Commission.Younis has even threatened that he will not allow her go back to India alive. He reportedly married another woman, a Pakistani.Hajara Begum said her daughter had turned very weak due to physical and mental torture and needs immediate medical help.Mohammedi Begum and Younis have five children -- three sons and two daughters. The youngest son is nine-year-old and he was born in Pakistan while the other children were born in Muscat, Oman."If the children come with her that will be good but my appeal is that she should be brought home immediately," said Hajara Begum.It was on March 16 that Sushma had sought a report from India High Commissioner Gautam Bambawale.Mohammedi Begum's father Mohammed Akbar, a cycle mechanic, had earlier sent an e-mail to Sushma Swaraj in January seeking her help in bringing back his daughter.He alleged that Muhammad Younis, who concealed his actual nationality and claimed to be from Oman, married her in 1996.The 'nikah' was performed over telephone through some agent and Begum joined Younis, a mechanic, in Muscat. After 12 years of marriage, Begum got a shock when Younis, who had lost his job, disclosed that he was a Pakistani.Mohammedi Begum had visited Hyderabad in 2012. Her father said this was her only visit to India in 21 years.(With inputs from IANS) 
Union Minister for Water Recourses Uma Bharti on Monday sais that the ruling Bhartiya Janta Party will have to stay alert and on a continuous vigil as there was no Opposition in the country. "We have just recorded an unprecedented victory in the biggest state of India. We also have a majority in the Lok Sabha. The biggest take away of this election is that the popularity of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has increased from what it was in May 2014 but at the same time we can see that that there is no Opposition. So we will have to perform the role of the Opposition as well," Bharti said while addressing a press conference in Bhopal."These election results have shown that we have reached a position which the Congress had occupied for a long time after the Bangladesh war of liberation but at that time we were a strong Opposition and provided the glue around which all opposition parties stuck. The Congress, however, is not in that position and is fast losing the little credibility that it had. The party does not have any standing of its own and is trying to latch on to regional players for face saving. This puts an additional responsibility on the BJP," Bharti said.On parallels being drawn between her coronation as chief minister in 2003 and that of Yogi Adityanath as chief minister of Uttar Pradesh in 2017, Bharti said, "The saffron colour of robes is not the only similarity that we have. He is like my younger brother and I stay at the Gorakhpur math whenever I go there but the colour of the robes has nothing to do with the performance of any chief minister. Adityanath is an able administrator and he will take strong steps to improve the law and order situation in the state.
New Delhi, Mar 20 (PTI) Gopal Ansal surrendered today before Tihar jail authorities to undergo one-year jail term in the 1997 Uphaar fire tragedy case after the Supreme Court refused to grant him more time. A bench comprising Chief Justice J S Khehar and Justices D Y Chandrachud and S K Kaul rejected the plea moved by the real estate baron seeking more time to surrender on the ground that he has moved a mercy plea before the President, and had asked him to surrender by this evening. "Ansal surrendered around 5-5.30 PM. He is currently lodged in the hospital at Jail No. 3 as he complained of some health issues," said a jail official. The bench said, "Sorry, we cant," when senior advocate Ram Jethmalani mentioned the matter and sought more time, telling the court that they have already approached the President with their mercy plea. The apex court also rejected the plea from the senior advocate seeking a direction for speedy disposal of his mercy plea, pending before the President, saying that it cannot interfere in it as it is an exclusive jurisdiction of the President. The apex court, on March 9, had dismissed Ansals petition for parity with his elder brother Sushil Ansal, who was awarded jail term already undergone by him considering his "age-related complications", and directed him to surrender by today to serve the prison term. 69-year-old Gopal Ansal was in jail earlier for around four-and-a-half-month in connection with the case relating to the June 13, 1997 fire tragedy in which 59 persons had died in Uphaar cinema during the screening of Hindi movie Border. Over 100 people were injured in the subsequent stampede. A bench headed by Justice Gogoi, in a 2:1 majority verdict on February 9, had granted relief to 76-year-old Sushil Ansal considering age-related complications by awarding him the jail term already undergone and had asked Gopal to surrender in four weeks to serve the remaining jail term. Gopal had thereafter approached the apex court seeking modification of its order on the grounds of parity, saying he was 69-year-old and would suffer irreparable damage to his health if sent to prison.

The BJP today dismissed reports that the RSS had anything to do with the selection of hardliner Yogi Adityanath as the Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister and said it is unfair to criticise the decision without giving the Gorakhpur MP a "fair opportunity" to govern."The RSS (Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh) never interferes with the selection of chief ministers," Union Minister M Venkaiah Naidu said a day after Adityanath took over as the 21st Chief Minister of the state.A number of the former or serving members of the RSS, which is the ideological fountainhead of the BJP, have been appointed Chief Ministers recently. Uttarakhand's Trivendra Singh Rawat is a former RSS pracharak, so is Maharashtra's Devendra Fadnavis and Haryana's Manohar Lal Khattar.Naidu, who is the BJP's in-charge for Uttar Pradesh, also sought to allay the fears that Adityanath's image as a Hindutva poster boy will have a bearing on his work as the Chief Minister. "It is very unfair to criticise Yogi Adityanath without giving him a fair opportunity," he said. "Yogi Adityanathji will care for all the sections of the people and will prove his critics wrong. He will become one of the most successful CMs ever," he added."The safety of the people is of prime importance. There will be zero tolerance towards crime," Adityanath's minister Shrikant Sharma said.On Sunday, shortly after he took oath, Yogi Adityanath had pledged to work for all sections without bias and said he believed in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's slogan: 'sabka saath sabka vikas'.Addressing his first press conference after taking oath, the controversial Gorakhpur MP also vowed to end the law and order problems in the sprawling and the country's most populous state.In an apparent move to allay fears that he, as a long-time Hindutva icon, might discriminate against the minorities, Adityanath promised there would be no bias for or against anyone.
Stephen Hawking, the leading British physicist and cosmologist, has said he no longer feels welcome in the US under Donald Trump.Prof Hawking is a recipient of the prestigious US Franklin medal for science and received the presidential medal of freedom from Barack Obama in 2009. Now he has spoken out about his fears for the country?s ?definite swing to a rightwing, more authoritarian approach?.?I would like to visit again and to talk to other scientists, but I fear that I may not be welcome,? he said in an interview with Good Morning Britain on Monday.The 75-year-old Cambridge scientist said he was particularly concerned about Trump?s environment policy.?He should replace Scott Pruitt at the Environment Protection Agency,? he said. ?Climate change is one of the great dangers we face, and it?s one we can prevent. It affects America badly, so tackling it should win votes for his second term. God forbid.?Hawking has previously described Trump as a demagogue. ?Trump was elected by people who felt disenfranchised by the governing elite in a revolt against globalisation,? he told ITV1?s breakfast programme. ?His priority will be to satisfy his electorate, who are neither liberal nor that well informed.?Hawking said, however, that he saw signs of hope for the world in the rise of women to powerful positions in public life, and he revealed his excitement at the possibility of sending tiny robots into space to investigate earth-like planets trillions of miles away.Asked about the ascent of Theresa May, Nicola Sturgeon and Cressida Dick, the new Met police commissioner, he said: ?If we factor in high-powered women in Europe as well, such as Angela Merkel, it seems we are witnessing a seismic shift for women to accede to high-level positions in politics and society. ?But there may still be a gap between those women achieving high public status and those in the private sector. I welcome these signs of women?s liberation.?When asked whether he thought the Nasa space programme should be restarted following the discovery of new planets, Hawking said: ?The recently discovered system of seven Earth-sized planets is 39 light years away. With current technology there is no way we can travel that far. ?The best we can envisage is robotic nanocraft pushed by giant lasers to 20% of the speed of light. These nanocraft weigh a few grams and would take about 240 years to reach their destination and send pictures back. It is feasible and is something that I am very excited about.?On British politics, Hawking said he felt a ?hard Brexit? should be resisted, with the UK retaining strong links with the EU and China. He also said that Labour, which he backed at the 2015 general election, would not win the next election under Jeremy Corbyn. ?He doesn?t come across as a strong leader, and he allowed the media to portray him as a leftwing extremist, which he?s not,? he said. ?It?s no good having the right principles if you never get in power.?

Chinese archaeologists today said that they have recovered more than 10,000 gold and silver items that sank to the bottom of a river in southwestern Sichuan Province over 300 years ago.The items included a large amount of gold, silver and bronze coins and jewellery as well as iron weapons such as swords, knifes and spears, said Gao Dalun, director of Sichuan Provincial Cultural Relics and Archaeology Research Institute.The characters carved in the gold and silver utensils are still clear and the embossed patterns on the jewellery show exquisite craftsmanship, state-run news agency Xinhua quoted archaeologists as saying.The treasure site, located in the intersection of Minjiang river and its branch Jinjiang river, is 50 kms away south of Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan Province.It is believed that in 1646, peasant uprising leader Zhang Xianzhong was defeated in the area by Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) soldiers while attempting to transfer his treasure to the south. About 1,000 boats loaded with money and valuables sank during the skirmish."The objects have helped identify the area where the battle was fought and are direct evidence of this historical event," said Wang Wei, a Chinese archaeologist.Sichuan launched the exploration project in January when the dry season arrived. Several water pumps were used to drain water away day and night.Hundreds of meters of the river bed appeared after archaeologists dug five meters down, where they found the relics."The items are extremely valuable to science, history and art. They are of great significance for research into the political,economic, military and social lives of the Ming Dynasty," said Li Boqian, an archaeologist from Peking University.Archaeologists said the excavation will last until April and the team expects to unearth more items. 
New Delhi, Mar 17 (PTI) A parliamentary panel today sought a probe into defunct Kingfisher Airlines allowed to accumulate high levels of dues to state-owned AAI, which was in "violation of all existing rules". Bogged down by financial woes, Kingfisher Airlines was closed down in 2012. The carrier was promoted by businessman Vijay Mallya, who is wanted by Indian authorities for loan default and other cases. At the end of December 2016, the airline owed dues worth Rs 294.69 crore to the Airports Authority of India (AAI) and the amount has been written off. The national airports operator has also filed a legal suit against the carrier to recover the dues. Pulling up the AAI, the panel said it allowed the accumulation of dues to such a high level in violation of all the existing rules and procedures in practice. Besides, the committee has recommended that AAI may conduct an internal inquiry to "fix the responsibility of AAI officials for the accumulation of dues by Kingfisher Airlines". The recommendation has been made by the Department- related Parliamentary Standing Committee on Transport, Tourism and Culture in its report tabled in Parliament today. The report is on the Demand for Grants (2017-18) of the Ministry of Civil Aviation.

They used 2-inch mortars, automatic weapons, while the Indian troops responded befittingly,"?said Lt Col Munish Mehta.No injuries to Indian troops reported. 
Aamir Khan possesses a Midas touch. All his films are almost guaranteed to strike box-office gold, and his last release, Dangal, was no different. Dangal broke all records to become the highest grossing Bollywood film ever, and if a report DNA is to be believed, the actor received a handsome return.An industry insider is quoted as saying, "Aamir himself has earned a humongous Rs 175 crore (approx) from the film with the kind of profit-sharing partnership he entered into with co-producers Disney UTV. While he took Rs 35 crore upfront he also took 33 per cent of partnership as he always does for his films. And will take 33 per cent royalty in whatever money the film earns in the future, including satellite rights."With that whopping sum as his fee, Aamir is probably the highest paid actor in B-Town right now.

A flight lieutenant was caught stealing a wallet from a CSD canteen in Mumbai on CCTV cameras and has been court-martialled by the Indian Air Force for the petty theft worth Rs 531.The incident had happened when the officer (name withheld) - who gets a salary of around Rs 65,000-70,000 per month - visited the CSD canteen in the Madh Island air force base in Mumbai in February 2013 to buy something and stole one of the two black wallets kept there, an IAF officerl told Mail Today.The theft of the wallet could not be detected by the canteen officers for two days and an investigation into the matter had started when one of the wallet covers was found lying empty, they said."When the CCTV footage was checked, it was observed that the officer of the rank of Flt Lt had picked up the wallet and put it in his rear trouser pocket for concealing it from canteen staff, and after that, he was attached for trial by the authorities concerned," said the officer.The General Court Martial also found him guilty and recommended him to be severely reprimanded, pay back Rs 531 as the cost of the wallet stolen by him to the unit and also forfeit one-year service for the purpose of promotion.However, the then Air Force chief took a lenient view of the case and removed the loss of seniority from his punishment but the officer decided to approach the Armed Forces Tribunal to get the proceedings against him to be quashed completely.
New Delhi, Mar 19 (PTI) Embattled Air Costa has seen an exodus of employees, including 40 pilots, in the last few weeks over non-payment of salaries. The airline, which has cancelled bookings till May, is scrambling for funds to restart its operations but is yet to make much headway in roping in investors. Air Costas 450-odd employees are literally at the crossroads amid worsening financial situation, and industry executives apprehend there could be a replay of erstwhile Kingfisher Airlines -- whose shuttering in 2012 had rendered hundreds of people jobless. 
London, Mar 18 (PTI) A five-legged lamb has been born at a farm in the UK and named after a Tom Hanks character. The Texel Mule cross was born on Thursday in Derbyshire and farm owner Mark Bayley said he was totally healthy. The Bayley family nicknamed the young male Forrest in the hope his extra limb gives him the same love of running as film character Forrest Gump. Bayley said although it was tempting to sell Forrest for meat, he would probably be kept as a family pet, the BBC reported. The extra limb, which sits just behind Forrests left front leg, is slightly shorter than the other four so is not interfering with his mobility at the farm in Ashbourne. 
New Delhi, Mar 19 (PTI) Describing demonetisation as an attempt akin to striking a rock with an egg, eminent Austrian economist Heinz D Kurz has said it is much too weak and misdirected an instrument to root out corruption. Actually, he said, the Indian governments move opened up new avenues of corruption. "As far as I understand the situation, the policy of demonetisation has already been abandoned by the government, because it turned out to be an attempt akin to striking a rock with an egg. "I strongly doubt that the demonetisation exercise will root out corruption and engender more transparency. It is much too weak and misdirected an instrument to achieve these goals," Kurz told PTI in an interview. "By introducing the Rs 2,000 banknote, a currency of twice or even four times the value of the banknotes that have been declared illegal, in the system... This can hardly be called demonetisation," he added. Kurz is a professor of economics at the University of Graz, Austria. Noting that while the goal of fighting corruption is laudable, he said: "I consider it to be singularly naive to think that this can be done by banning some banknotes. "There appears also to be evidence that the policy of demonetisation opened new channels of corruption." Kurz pointed out that whoever was informed about the demonetisation policy ahead of its introduction (sort of insider trading) could have used the information and laundered money. Also, he further said Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 banknotes brought to banks were apparently counted, but not scrutinised as to whether it was counterfeit money. Asked about impact of demonetisation on Indias economic growth, Kurz said that "first, it is much too early to assess already the impact of demonetisation, which will show up only later. Secondly, the data published are rough estimates that do not, and could not possibly, take account of this impact". "It would therefore be wrong to infer that demonetisation had no effect on the economy," he noted. The Indian economy is going pretty strong, Kurtz said, adding however that not well thought out policies such as the demonetisation project have the potential of affecting it badly. 
After 14 years of protracted litigation, a 74-yearold woman won a case against Indian Railways after she lost her valuables while travelling to Secunderabad.The consumer court directed Indian Railways to pay Radha Ramnathan Rs 1,34,400 for being negligent in its services, causing mental agony. It said once the passenger takes the ticket and travels by a train, it is the responsibility of the railway to see that the passenger reaches the destination safely with his luggage and belongings. It is the duty of the railway staff to see that the belongings of the passengers are safe.In 2003, Radha had booked a ticket in AC 3-tier in Kongu Express to attend a religious ceremony of her grandson in Secunderabad.She was carrying a gold chain, diamond rings, a gold coin and other valuables, worth over a lakh of rupees.She claimed that there was no chain under her seat with which she could fasten the luggage and many unauthorised passengers had entered into the coach.'RAILWAY OFFICIALS DID NOT HELP'"Neither the ticket collector nor the Railway Protection Force took any step to get them out despite complainants raising objection to it," she said.

Virat Kohli is the "head of the snake". This is how Australia spinner Nathan Lyon described the India captain in the second Test in Bengaluru. Kohli's aggressive nature on the field has earned him admiration in the cricketing world but Australians also hate him.Former Australia batsman Dean Jones in his column for The Sydney Morning Herald explained how "Kohli is almost as disliked as English captain Douglas Jardine".The second Test of the series became a hot topic when the captains of both teams Virat Kohli and Steve Smith traded blows at each other. Kohli almost called Australians "cheats" when Smith, to everyone's surprise, tried to take help with DRS from his team's dressing room after he was trapped leg before by Umesh Yadav. Kohli warned the Aussies for "crossing the line" then two boards jumped in and backed their captains before International Cricket Council put an end to the controversy by not pressing charges against either of the players."Kohli is now Australia's No. 1 enemy or the "head of the snake", as Nathan Lyon has put it. The Australian boys are quite prepared to take it up to him and this series has been compulsive viewing. This is what Test match cricket is about. It's the same when we play England for the Ashes or when India meet Pakistan," Jones wrote in his column. (Ranchi Test: Kohli bats at usual No.4 but falls cheaply again)"Test cricket is at its best when there is an edge to it. With the extra interest from fans and the media in a big series such as this, the contest seems to have become personal, very personal," he added.Jones further praised Kohli for his work ethics but said the Indian cricket's poster boy "loves getting into hot spots on the field"."I am an unabashed Kohli fan. I commentate all around the world and I love watching this kid bat and lead his team. He is such an interesting character. Away from the cricket, he is quite a humble kid. Always polite, and always asking questions on how he is batting and what I am up to. He just loves the game and the challenges that go with it." (Maxwell mocks Kohli's injury)'VILLAINOUS AS JARDINE'"Kohli believes in hard work and that he can do anything on a cricket field. He loves getting into hot spots on the field to make sure he is in his opponents' face. Kohli is the only captain I know who pumps up the crowd, asking them for their support. He knows the importance of the Indian fans' input and how it can help his team's performance. He doesn't just want 11 Indian players in the Australian faces, he demands the same from the 30,000-strong Indian crowds. Make this ground the most hostile environment the Australians will experience. It's no different to what the MCG crowds have given to opposition teams.""So why don't?Australian fans like him? I feel he is almost as disliked as villainous English captain Douglas Jardine, who started the Bodyline series in 1932-33. Is this what needs to happen for Australia and India to build up their rivalry? If so, I have no problem with it. I love the aggression that's being produced in the media and from the fans. Even the respective CEOs from each country have offered their 10 cents' worth. It's game on," he wrote.WATCH SPORTS WRAPJones also tipped Australian cricketers, who are part of the Test series in India, how to tackle Kohli's "in-your-face attitude".

New Delhi, Mar 19 (PTI) The Railways aims to cut down its water bill and save up to Rs 400 crore annually with a roadmap for buying recycled water from private players. With the dual aim of conserving the precious resource and reducing its consumption, the Railways will unveil its water policy, a first for the national transporter, for extensive use of treated water from water treatment plants for non-drinking purposes. The Indian Railways Water Policy, expected to be rolled out on March 22 (World Water Day), will spell out the way forward for all the railway zones including colonies, hospitals, factories, workshops and training centres to achieve the goal of reduced consumption and increased use of recycled water. Currently, the Railways buys water from the states and its water bill is about Rs 4,000 crore a year. "The water policy envisages buying treated water from water treatment plants for two paise per litre, while we now purchase water for seven paise per litre," said a senior Railway Ministry official. The policy has drawn out a detailed framework for setting up water treatment plants with private participation to generate an adequate amount of treated water for non-potable purposes. The private players will be encouraged to set up these plants and the Railways will ensure the purchase of treated water from these units, said the official. The water policy also envisages the revival of all the defunct water bodies on railway land across the country, various ways of recharging groundwater, including rainwater harvesting in all railway buildings.

Mumbai, Mar 18 (PTI) Days after terming the protectionist bent of the Donald Trump regime as a "blessing in disguise", Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani today said its "high time" we promoted reverse brain-drain wherein our brightest talent come back and serve the homeland. "Its high time that our brightest and the best work for the benefit of India and Indians," Ambani said. When asked whether he sees a reverse brain-drain, he quipped "without doubt". "By whatever fate they are brought back to this country, they can help improve the lives of 1.3 billion citizens and put together a new developmental model...there cannot be a better blessing in disguise than that," Ambani told the India Today conclave here. He said of late RIL is getting many Indians who have held leadership roles in other countries in the past. RIL is getting at least two-three such talent every month, he said. "We have more talent knocking at our doors because at the end of the day, har ek ka dil hain Hindustani. People want to do things for India," he said. Addressing the annual Nasscom summit here last month, Ambani had said the Trump administrations protectionist policies like limiting the number of H1B visas, could prove to be a blessing in disguise for the country. "Trump can actually be a blessing in disguise. Our IT industry can focus on solving the problems right here, which is a huge market," he had said in a stance which was seen as contrary to the prevailing atmosphere of paranoia and fear about the future. Ambani today said we are fortunate to be an open market with a leader who understands technology. He recalled how Prime Minister Narendra Modi spent an entire dinner meeting with the last American president Barack Obama discussing how technology could resolve many of the problems the world is seeped in.

Sooraj Pancholi, whose relationship with late actor Jiah Khan stirred up a storm, has finally moved on and found love again. Talking to Filmfare, the actor said, "I'm in a relationship. She's not from this industry. She's a nice girl... I always wanted my partner to be a simple person. She can do what she wants, wear what she wants, work wherever she wants. I wanted a simple soul and I guess I've found her."Sooraj, unlike most of his contemporaries, does not mind being in the news for his link-ups. However, he does have a problem if his family is made a part of it. "If I've decided to be a celebrity, I know that it comes at a cost. But people should understand where to draw the line. I don't like it when my family is dragged into things... I walked out of a restaurant with my sister Sana and the next day it was all over the media, 'Sooraj seen with a mystery girl'. That mystery girl was my sister. It's not fair. They should have some protocol."On the work front, Sooraj was last seen in the 2015 film, Hero (also his debut), opposite Athiya Shetty. He will be seen next in a film written by Farook Kabir, based on a true story. Talking about why he took so long to sign on his second film, he said, "It has been a long wait.

Jail has made Sanjay Dutt a changed man, and as it turns out, a poet as well.While the Munna Bhai actor was in Yerwada jail, he penned a number of poems, one of which called O Meri Aangan Ki Chidiya Hai Tu will be used in his upcoming film Torbaaz.Sanjay Dutt is playing an army officer in Torbaaz, directed by Girish Malik. The film set in Afghanistan is an action thriller and revolves around the phenomenon of young children being indoctrinated to think that there is glory awaiting in afterlife after killing for virtuous reasons. This is the first time an Indian film will deal with the theme of child soldiers.According to a report in Mumbai Mirror, the producer of Torbaaz got emotional when he heard the song O Meri Aangan Ki Chidiya Hai Tu at Sanjay Dutt's residence."Girish and I had gone to meet Sanju in Agra where he is filming Bhoomi. He hummed a few songs he had penned when he was in prison. He has a scratch version recorded and I was touched by one particular song. O Meri Aangan Ki Chidiya Hai Tu is about a father-daughter relationship. It's beautifully written and is relevant to our film as Sanju's character loses his child. I got very emotional when I heard it and told him we would like to use it in Torbaaz. He readily agreed," Torbaaz producer Rahul Mittra was quoted as saying.In fact, while he was in jail, Sanjay Dutt wrote songs across genres including some romantic numbers and qawwalis.Sanjay Dutt has previously lent his voice to a number of songs throughout his career. Some of the most popular ones are Aye Shivani from Khoobsurat, the title track of Chal Mere Bhai and Samjho Ho Hi Gaya from Lage Raho Munna Bhai.
Pakistan's disgraced former Test captain Salman Butt, who has served a five-year ban for spot-fixing, has urged cricket authorities to target those who try to corrupt players at any level of the game."The players are seen as the main culprits whenever some corruption comes out. But I think the International Cricket Council and its member boards also need to think about how to also punish those people who try to lure players into fixing," Butt said on Geo Super channel.Butt, who was the mastermind of the 2010 spot-fixing scandal during Pakistan's tour of England, said that until people, who try to corrupt cricketers are also punished, it would be difficult to eradicate the menace."We have seen players who get caught in this fixing racket get punished. I have been through it and have paid heavily for it. I have learnt my lesson. But what about those who induce us into such practice," he said.

President Pranab Mukherjee may have just served a reminder to Prime Minister Narendra Modi about the economic growth rate. He also praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for being very observant.Delivering the special address at the India Today Conclave 2017 in Mumbai, President Mukherjee said, "Four of the five years during the UPA-I the growth rate was more than 8 per cent. The base of Indian economy was so strong that it sustained 2008 global economic crisis."He said that rate of investment was about 38 per cent of the GDP with sound rate of savings.Mukherjee emphasised that the various governments (led by Congress party) worked hard to streamline and strengthen the fundamentals of Indian economy.'INDIA WAS ASSERTIVE EARLIER ALSO'President Mukherjee seems to have served another reminder to PM Modi by referring to 'aggression' shown by Indira Gandhi during 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War."That was the highpoint of assertion and aggression. If that was not aggression, then what is aggression of Indian nation," Mukherjee asked.Indira Gandhi expressed India's concerns through 1971 assertion, Mukherjee underscored, adding that it was India's strong response that Pakistan was forced to declare unilateral ceasefire.PM Modi has been talking about surgical strike as the first real assertion by Indian state against the rogue behaviour of Pakistan.President Mukherjee reminded the nation of the contributions of first Prime Minister of India Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru for laying the foundation of democracy in India.MUKHERJEE PRAISED MODIShowering lavish praise on Narendra Modi, Mukherjee said that he has acquired mastery over external affairs, foreign economy."He is observant. I appreciate when he said that you can win election by majority but to rule you need consensus," Mukherjee said about Modi.He related a story about Atal Bihari Vajpayee when he requested Pranab Mukherjee not to be very harsh on the then George Fernandes, who was being attacked in Parliament over coffin scandal after Kargil war.Mukherjee served under four Prime Ministers as ministers beginning with Indira Gandhi and followed by Rajiv Gandhi, Narsimha Rao and Manmohan Singh.DISRUPTION IN PARLIAMENTPresident Mukherjee expressed concerns over continued disruption in Parliament."Enormous power is vested in members elected to Parliament and Legislative Assemblies. Their primary job to make laws," Mukherjee said.Talking about Anna Hazare's anti-graft movement, he said that agitation was a message that the Lok Sabha had failed in doing its primary duty of framing an anti-corruption law, a Lokpal law despite several committees recommending for it."In the first Lok Sabha during 1952-57, total 677 sittings of Parliament were held and 319 bills passed. But, in contrast the 15th Lok Sabha saw only 357 sittings and only 180 bills were passed because the disease of disruption has crept in," Mukherjee said."Disruption in Parliament and law making is unacceptable to me," President asserted adding, "In 15th Lok Sabha, as much as 46.1 per cent of allotted time was lost to disruption."A visibly upset President said Session after session lapsed without passing a law. Who will make law then, he asked. CAG report is presented to the Lok Sabha. Who will examine it, he wondered.The first annual Budget of India was of Rs 397 crore only while the today India's Budget stands at Rs 17 lakh crore, Mukherjee said.

Aam Aadmi Party chief Arvind Kejriwal has written a letter to party workers, demoralised after the AAP's recent loses in Punjab and Goa Assembly elections. The party was especially betting big on Punjab, which sent four AAP leaders to the Lok Sabha in the 2014 general election. The party won 20 constituencies in Punjab, narrowly beating the Shiromani Akali Dal-Bhartiya Janata Party combine's 18 seats to emerge as the principal opposition in the state. In Goa, on the other hand, AAP failed to open its tally, losing in all the constituencies the party contested in. Delhi chief minister Kejriwal's morale-boosting letter, sent to all APP volunteers, comes just ahead of Delhi municipal polls, scheduled for April 22.ALSO READ | Congress to use Punjab Assembly elections results against AAP in MCD poll campaigns
In the wake of allegations of rigging of electronic voting machines (EVMs) in the recently concluded Uttar Pradesh assembly election, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has said that the Election Commission should convene an all-party meeting to discuss the matter."Whether one would accept or not is absolutely their choice. But the Election Commission may call an all-party meeting. Let the issue be discussed", Mamata said.When asked whether she was in favour of an investigation into the charges of tampering of EVMs, she said, "I have seen the Election Commissioner's version that there is nothing. But I have also gone through a video tape of BJP leader Subramanian Swamy in which he says these EVMs can be tampered with."Banerjee showed journalists footages of Swamy's video in which he talked about the possibility of voting machines being manipulated.SWAMY'S VIEW BASIS FOR MAMATA's DEMAND FOR PROBEIn the video clips, Swamy is seen saying that the EVMs were made in Japan, but ballot papers were used even there during elections because the machines could be rigged to favour a certain outcome.Even countries like the United States and Germany are using ballot papers instead of EVMs, the BJP leader was heard saying in the footage.Describing Swamy as "very strong legally", the Trinamool Congress supremo said, "What he (Swamy) has said is not wrong. He has not said anything bad. I have not said anything, but I think there can be an investigation into this issue."Incidentally, Mayawati had accused the BJP of murdering democracy following her party's drubbing in the Uttar Pradesh election, saying that the EVMs were tampered in such a way that only votes cast for the BJP were accepted. The Bahujan Samaj Party chief had even alleged that had it not been for the rigging of voting machines, BJP wouldn't have won from Muslim bastions in the state.Even Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has raised concerns of tampering of EVMs. Stating that the poll outcome in Punjab was completely unexpected for the Aam Aadmi Party, Kejriwal has also asked the poll panel to probe the possibility of EVMs being rigged.Also read | EVMs cannot be tampered with, integrity of electoral process intact: Election CommissionAlso read | AAP was sweeping Punjab, even BJP's Advani doubted EVMs: Kejriwal asks EC to probe alleged tampering

Recovering from a shoulder injury, India skipper Virat Kohli missed the start of day two proceedings on the field as his deputy Ajinkya Rahane led the team against Australia in the third Test in Ranchi. (Scorecard)Umesh Yadav confirmed in a post-match press conference after the second day play that Kohli is fit to play and is all set to come back. He said, "Bandage will obviously remain after an injury. But I think he's fit to play. The way he's practising at the nets it seems he's all set to come back." (Ranchi Test, Day 2: Key Highlights)A grimacing Kohli had departed the field on day one clutching his right shoulder after he landed awkwardly near the mid-on boundary rope in his dive to save a Peter Handscomb boundary. Kohli was seen joining his teammates at the warm-up before the start of play and had a long discussion with coach Anil Kumble and selector Devang Gandhi."Jadeja is going through the best phase of his career"India's Ravindra Jadeja made two important points with his seventh five-wicket Test haul on Friday - that he is not in the team just to play second fiddle to spin colleague Ravichandran Ashwin and that he does not need dustbowls to succeed.If India are still in the third Test against Australia, it is due largely to the indefatiguable left-arm spinner who came up with a lion-hearted effort to restrict the tourists. (India vs Australia, 3rd Test, Day 2: As it happened)Jadeja bowled more than one third of his team's total overs, claimed 5/124 and effected a spectacular run-out with his back to the stumps to wrap up the Australia innings.The 28-year-old became the leading wicket-taker in the four-Test series, overtaking off-spinner Ashwin, who has taken only one in the match. (Virat Kohli joins team in warm-up, but does not field on Day 2)Jadeja is level on points with Ashwin at the top of the ICC rankings for Test bowlers and the bearded all-rounder with tousled hair proved why."Jaddu is going through the best phase of his career," Yadav said after the second day's play."I think Jaddu is the kind of bowler whose bowling style suits all kind of wickets. The kind of variation he has, he never moves away and bowls tirelessly at the same spot. (Ranchi Test: Vijay, KL Rahul lead India's charge after Australia's 451)"If he gets the tiniest of rough, he knows where to pitch it. He is getting the reward for his accuracy."On a track which has not offered prodigious turn or uneven bounce yet, Jadeja's exploits drew praise from Australian all-rounder Glenn Maxwell. (Gallery)"He was hitting a consistent spot where, if it skidded on straight it was hitting the stumps, and if it spun you were a chance to nick it," said Maxwell, who scored his maiden test century on Friday."It was just an awkward length. It took him a while to find that length against us. We were able to find singles and manipulate the field a bit yesterday afternoon but today he was pretty accurate."
AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi has termed the Uttar Pradesh Assembly election results as "an exclusive verdict" saying that "in the battle of Kabristan and Shamshaan, Shamshaan won over Kabristan."Speaking at the India Today Conclave 2017 in Mumbai, Owaisi today said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi tried to polarise the election by referring to graveyard and cremation ground."The Uttar Pradesh Assembly election was an exclusive verdict. It was the verdict for development of some and not for inclusive development. In the battle of Kabristan and Shamshaan in Uttar Pradesh Assembly election, Shamshaan won over Kabristan," Owaisi said.Responding to Owaisi's charge, Jammu and Kashmir Social Welfare Minister Sajjad Lone said, "You can't question winning in a democracy. I don't agree that it was an exclusive election verdict in Uttar Pradesh."If you accept democracy, you accept winning in election, you can't question that, Sajjad Lone said.BJP Rajya Sabha MP Vinay Sahasrabuddhe countered Owaisi by claiming that large number of Muslims voted for the BJP in Uttar Pradesh.We have had spiritual democracy. Imposing one ideology or thought is not possible in India. India is a vibrant democracy. Nobody can destroy that, Sahasrabudde said.COUNTER-NARRATIVE TO CHECK BJPDuring the India Today Conclave session on 'The Great Debate: A Million Mutinies, What makes an Indian?', some of the panelists underscored the need for the Opposition to have a counter-narrative to check the BJP.Noted sociologist Dipankar Gupta said, "The Opposition needs to have an alternative discourse not an anti-BJP narrative to check the rise of the BJP. An alternative point of view is needed to counter the BJP," adding, "It could be Congress or without Congress."'RAHUL NO COMPETITION TO MODI'Gupta further said that as the principal Opposition party the Congress needs to reinvent itself.Responding to a query about Rahul Gandhi, Gupta said, "Congress identified in Punjab with Amarinder Singh and it won the election. In Uttar Pradesh, Congress identified with Gandhi and it lost. In Gandhi background the Congress was soundly defeated while in Punjab they won. Rahul (Gandhi) is no competition to (Narendra) Modi in providing leadership."Agreeing with Gupta, Owaisi said, "Days of dynastic politics are over. You will have to prove yourself that you work for people."On the question of having an alternative narrative, Owaisi said, "If you want to defeat Modi, don't become junior Modi. Create an alternative viewpoint."Among the participants in the debate was noted musician TM Krishna, who had questioned Finance Minister Arun Jaitley when he criticised some protesters at JNU and Delhi by calling their agitation as 'alliance of subversion'. ICSSR chairman Sukhadeo Thorat, who is former UGC chairman and professor emeritus JNU, said, "The idea of India is defined by constitution. It says that India is secular and socialist."The governments supported by majority population or religious community are cause for worry in India, Thorat said.?
Former India captain Sourav Ganguly spoke exclusively to India Today after Australia dominated India on Day 1 of the third and penultimate Test match in Ranchi on Wednesday. Australia reached 299/4 at stumps with captain Steve Smith (117*) and Glenn Maxwell (82*) unbeaten at the crease. (Ranchi Test: Smith, Maxwell lead Australian domination over India)CLICK TO WATCH FULL INTERVIEWGanguly spoke at length on the Smith's magnificent hundred, on what should be India's gameplan on Day 2 in Ranchi and why Virat Kohli's loss in form does not bother him too much. (SCORECARD)Excerpts:Rohan Sen: Australia dominated proceedings on a flat pitch in Ranchi. Your assessment of the day's play?Sourav Ganguly: I think the pitch played superbly that's what you expect on Day 1 of a Test match in India and Australia dominated. Good toss to win which is always the case in India. Australia had the best part of the surface to play on. (Ranchi Test: Virat Kohli advised 10 days rest by doctors)Rohan: We finally got to see some action on the cricket field as supposed to off it with the DRS controversy last week?Ganguly: That's happened and that's part and parcel of the sport. I wouldn't pay too much importance on that. Virat Kohli said at the press conference yesterday that "it's game time and let's move on". That's exactly what mature people do. They've moved on.Steve Smith has moved on, what a wonderful hundred he's got today. In the centre of all the talk about his DRS reviews and the way he looked at the dressing room. But he's answered everyone with a Test match hundred. (Steve Smith hits back hard after ugly DRS spat with 19th Test hundred)Rohan: What is Steve Smith doing differently to Virat Kohli? Why is Kohli not able to score runs while Smith has already slammed two hundreds?Ganguly: Virat Kohli will score I think it's just one of those times when one person gets the runs and the other person doesn't get runs. There will be a time when Virat Kohli will score and Steve Smith will not score runs. Steve Smith likes batting against India to be honest. Four hundreds on the 2014-15 series in Australia and then two hundreds here along with the 2015 World Cup semi-final hundred. He loves Indian bowling you have got to give him credit. His records phenomenal. 19 Test hundreds in just 53 Test matches that's a fantastic record.Rohan: India's intensity dropped in the final session of play on Day 1. Do you think that is because Kohli was not on the field?Ganguly: These are after thoughts to be honest. You have got to give credit to the way Maxwell and Smith batted. Yes the captain makes a difference but if he's injured you know then Ajinkya Rahane takes on. But you've got to give credit to the way Maxwell and Smith batted.Rohan: Michael Clarke had recently said that David Warner should call Sourav and take tips on how to bat against spinners. Where is Warner going wrong?
Abhinav Bindra, Beijing Olympics Gold medal winner and India's most decorated shooter, revealed he was fighting epilepsy during the Rio Games. Speaking at the India Today Conclave, Bindra said he had been suffering since the 2014 Commonwealth Games.However, despite the odds, Bindra qualified for the finals of the men's 10 metre air rifle final event in Rio last August.But Bindra, who was a bright medal prospect for India, narrowly missed out on a medal after finishing fourth in the final at the Olympic Shooting Centre.Bindra did not however use his condition as an excuse in the Rio Games."I didn't end up fourth because my hands were shaking or because of the condition. I ended up fourth because I wasn't good enough ," Bindra said. Participating in his fifth Olympics, the 33-year-old got off to a good start with scores of 29.9 and 30.2 in the first two series placing him in the top three.He fell to the fourth spot after a relatively poor 21.1 in the third series with a total score of 81.2. But luck favoured Bindra in the fourth series as he climbed to second with 21.5 as the other shooters in the top four also faltered. However, Bindra seemed to let the pressure get to him as his performance started to go downhill from there. The former World Champion registered progressively poorer scores of 20.8, 20.2 in the next two series. A brilliant series of high 10s saw him go up to second after 11 shots and third after 12.Bindra had maintained the position till the 14th shot but a couple of poor shots saw him score 20.1 in what would eventually be his final series and tied at fourth with Ukranian Serhiy Kulish after the 16th shot. In the shoot-off that followed, Bindra could manage only a 10.0 while the Ukranian shot a brilliant 10.5 to move ahead, thus relegating the Indian to the fourth place.The ace Indian shooter said he had no regret after the heartbreak in Rio because he knew he had done the best he could.?Time is the best healer. You accept what the reality is and move on. Sometimes an event happens and then you move on. I was satisfied I tried the best I could. An athlete is scared of regret but I had no regret
Godrej Group Chairman Adi Godrej and Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) Chairman Deepak Parekh batted for the Goods and Service Tax (GST).Speaking on the day one of the India Today Conclave 2017 in Mumbai, the two industry leaders said that once the GST is rolled out, the economy is set to get a big boost.HDFC Chairman Deepak Parekh said that once the initial confusion around GST is dealt with, economists have projected that the GDP will go up.Adi Godrej concurred and said once the GST framework is in place, the situation on ground will change for the better. He said GST will check evasion of indirect taxes and reduce unaccounted money in the system. "Pay taxes or get out," the Godrej Group chairman said.An ideal GST will give us a benefit of 100 per cent; the present system will still give us a benefit of 80 if not 100, said Adi Godrej, allaying fears that GST will hit entrepreneurs.On fears of Inspector Raj coming back post-demonetisation, Deepak Parekh said cracking down on people holding black money is the right thing to do and such people ought to be penalised.Adi Godrej, however, differed and said that whenever a government has tried to control things, it has failed.Godrej said that while the objectives of the exercise were good but they should be achieved not just by cracking down but through incentivisation. "Whenever we have reduced the rate of taxes, we have had great success," he said. On the government's November 8, 2016 decision to demonetise high-value currency, Deepak Parekh backed it while Adi Godrej said he would have been more cautious if he were to make a similar decision.On the ease of doing business, both Deepak Parekh and Adi Godrej said India still has a long way to go. The reforms made at the Central level have not yet percolated to the state, said Deepak Parekh, asking states to shape up.
Mumbai, Mar 16 (PTI) Indrani Mukerjea, accused in the Sheena Bora murder case, today told the special CBI court here that she would oppose her estranged son Mekhails claim on Sheenas share of ancestral property. Mekhail Bora has moved the Guwahati district court, seeking probate (verification by court) of the will of his grandmother, Indrani told the court in Mumbai today. The Guwahati court directed that if Indrani, who is lodged in a prison here, had any objections she should submit them in person or through a lawyer. Indrani, who was present before the special court here, told the judge that she planned to object to Mekhails claim on Sheenas share of grandmothers property. Her (Indranis) mother had nowhere said that in the event of Sheenas death her share will go to Mekhail, Indrani said. 
 Founded in 1744, Scotland's Muirfield golf club is finally swinging its gates open for women. Believed to be the oldest in the world, the golf club will allow women to attain membership for the first time over the course of its history. Reportedly, the decision comes after the club lost out on a chance to host the "prestigious" Open Championship. Being welcomed by nearly everyone, including Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, the move is a long overdue step towards eradicating the skewed ideas that do not allow women to be members of world's most coveted golf clubs, The Guardian reports.

Buoyed by the party's success in Manipur, Assam BJP leader Himanta Biswa Sarma has said that they are confident of winning 19 seats out of 24 from the northeast in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.The BJP is upbeat after it formed its maiden government in Manipur led by N Biren Singh.Talking about the BJP's impressive show in Manipur, Sarma said, "This is the one state where BJP had no representation in the Assembly. From having no seat to winning 21 and then going on to form the government is a big achievement. This shows the faith and trust people of the northeast have in PM Modi."Now a convenor of the North East Democratic Alliance or NEDA, Sarma quit the Congress and joined the BJP in August 2015. This after he fell out with the Congress leadership for reportedly not considering him for the chief minister's post in Assam. MANIPUR SUCCESS HARD-EARNED: SARMA?Sarma added, "The hard work of BJP cadres paid off. We had planned this victory in Manipur about six months ago and started working hard for it."When asked how he saw BJP's gaining a stronghold in the northeast in the context of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, Sarma said, "Amit Shah laid special focus on the northeast as an area of expansion for the BJP. We are confident of winning 19 out of 24 seats from the northeast in the 2019 general elections. For this, we need more and more BJP governments in the region so that central schemes initiated by PM Modi can be implemented at the ground level."Talking about assembly elections in Nagaland, Manipur and Meghalaya, the 3 northeastern states that go to polls next year, he said, "We plan to wrest Tripura from the Left and Meghalaya from Congress."Reacting sharply to allegations by Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi that BJP undermined democracy by using money power to form its government in Manipur, Sarma said, "We got 30 or 31 seats not by luring people by offering them money. National People's Party (NPP) is a part of NEDA and so is the Naga People's Front. LJP led by Ram Vilas Paswan is already a part of the Union government. We got Manipur only by uniting friends. Rahul Gandhi has no political knowledge. His comments are based on the lines and statements fed to him by others. He doesn't even know where Manipur is on the map of India."SARMA LAUDS MODI'S FOCUS ON NORTHEASTPraising PM Modi's focus on developing the northeast, the Assam BJP leader said, "Under PM Modi, all Indian states are on the path of development. We want northeast to be at par with other states in the country. We want to integrate PM Modi's vision with northeast states to put them on the path of development."When asked about what he thought about Congress winning Punjab, Sarma said, "Congress' win in Punjab is mainly Captain Amarinder Singh's victory. It is about time Congress started thinking beyond the Gandhi family for its own good."He added, "Congress needs to get away from the high command culture and build regional satraps. The word Gandhi has become irrelevant for young India. People want to come out of a feudal mindset. People of India in the 21st century do not espouse family rule."Also read | Manipur: Defecting Cong MLA Shyam Kumar made minister in first BJP govt, gets showcause notice
Even as the BJP and the Opposition are still calculating if there was a shift in Muslim votes towards the saffron party in UP that contributed to its landslide victory, over a million Muslims from across the country - mostly women - have already signed a petition moved by RSS-affiliated Muslim body Muslim Rashtriya Manch (MRM) against the practice of triple talaq.The Muslim body - RSS pracharak Indresh Kumar is the liason from the Sangh's side who "guides" the MRM - has also called for a nationwide discussion on the issue that involves all the stakeholders."This is a problem of the community and the stakeholders within the community as well as the representatives from the state and the government must come and sit together to start a debate on this so that Muslim women can claim a human status," the organisation told Mail TodayBJP: TRIPLE TALAQ STAND HELPED PARTY IN UPAs the party itself puts it, one of the major contributing factors, as it claims, in its victory was a definite support from Muslim women who were moved by the party's stance on triple talaq as a repressive practice that needed to be done away with."Three factors, I suppose, defined our victory in the UP polls: first was Ujjwala scheme that provided LPG cylinders to poor women; second was construction of toilets under the Swachh Bharat programme, which also appealed to women; and last but not the least, our stand on triple talaq," said Sidharth Nath Singh, party secretary and newly elected MLA from Allahabad West.While the signature campaign of MRM is still on, the outfit had warned the traditionally conservative clergy of the community to desist from making a religious issue out of a practice that was a social problem."The fact that the BJP was able to get Muslim votes in UP, the fact that they also won the Muslim-majority Deoband seat - that is long supposed to be the stronghold of orthodox Ulema - suggest that the party and the central government need to heed the voice of the Muslim women. Their support in polls is a tacit approval of the BJP's stand on the issue," said MRM national coordinator Mohammad Afzal."The fact that the BJP did not field a single Muslim candidate for the UP polls did not deter women of the community to at least in part vote for the party," claimed another functionary of the MRM on conditions of anonymity.Afzal also said the traditional clergy of the community needed to wake up. "The fact that a terrorist was killed and his father denounced him in the light of the latter's love for the nation and then a girl is issued a fatwa against for singing?¦all these things point to the changing scenario in India. They should wake up now and stop trying to convert the social evil of triple talaq from a social problem into a religious problem."Even the great grandson of Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, a tall Muslim Congress leader of Indian history, extolled Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his "positive attitude towards the Muslims". "The Ulemas are taking the Muslim community not in the medieval ages, but the dark ages and towards the stone age," said Firoze Ahmad Bakht.
Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti has rebuffed the allegation against Prime Minister Narendra Modi that he is authoritarian in his approach.Participating in a debate at India Today Conclave 2017, Mehbooba said, "I have met Prime Minister Narendra Modi a few times and I have found that he is open to ideas. He is not authoritative.""Contrary to perception and allegations by some PM Modi is not centralised. He wants to make it true federal system in the country. He has the moral authority to do it," Mehbooba said.Mehbooba was in discussion with Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis.Mehbooba also said that the Centre and the state government both need to think about phasing out AFSPA from the Kashmir Valley.Inviting the businessmen and investors from Mumbai in Kashmir Valley, Mehbooba said, "Kashmir is the safest place for women even when encounters are taking place. Come not only to invest. Come to Kashmir with your families."FADNAVIS AS DEFENCE MINISTER?Taking part in the India Today Conclave 2017 in Mumbai, Devendra Fadnavis kept everyone guessing about him being moving to Delhi as a Union Minister.Responding to a query about the speculation that he could be the next Defence Minister, Fadnavis said, "India Today Conclave has shifted from New Delhi to Mumbai. Why do you want me to move from Mumbai to Delhi?"But, Fadnavis immediately added, "I am a true soldier of party. Whatever our Prime Minister and party president tells me to do, I am ready to do.""Right now I have a job on hand. I am a Chief Minister now. I have Maharashtra on my agenda."'ONLY FARMERS DON'T COMMIT SUICIDE'Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan asserted that his state no longer belonged to BIMARU state after registering double digit GDP growth rate in the last seven years.Chouhan tried to play down the issue of farmers' suicide in Madhya Pradesh saying, "Only farmers are not committing suicide. Students and businessmen are also committing suicide.""All suicides by the farmers are not due to loan or crop failure. There are other reasons also for farmers' suicide. We remain committed to ameliorate the living conditions of farmers," Chouhan said.THE GST QUESTIONResponding to a query about will July 1 deadline for GST be met, Fadnavis said, "Yes, I am confident. The deadline will be met. GST council has approved it. If political disruption is the motive then I can't say anything.""GST will create a common market. When VAT was introduced, there were concerns and apprehensions were expressed. VAT was a barrier regime. Now we are shifting to non-barrier regime. Barriers were artificially created," Fadnavis said."We are manufacturing state. As a big manufacturing state, we will lose something. But, at the same time being a big state, we are a big consumer state and there we will gain something," said Fadnavis."If some states lose more, then we must think that we are one nation. If some backward state gains and some better doing states are losing out, they should be happy. The GST will bring level playing field for everyone. Every state will gain with GST," Fadnavis added.APPRECIATE REGIONAL ASPIRATIONSJammu and Kashmir CM Mehbooba Mufti once again defended Article 370. She said every state has a unique situation. Maharashtra has Article 371 there, Jammu and Kashmir has Article 371, she said."You cannot do away with the regional aspirations. You have seen it after Mandal commission report. You have seen groups of Yadavs, rise of Mayawati and others," Mehbooba said."For us in Kashmir, India is not a country. It is a universe for us. It is full of diversity, different aspirations and all co-exist. It is the beauty of India," Mehbooba added.Mehbooba said that the Centre has been responsive about the needs of Jammu and Kashmir. "Whenever I have met Union Ministers, be it (Nitin) Gadkari or (Prakash) Javadekar, they have always listened to us and supported us. We have been given whatever we needed," Mehbooba said at India Today Conclave 2017.However, she was quick to add that in cases of international treaties if the states are affected then need to be consulted. DEMONETISATION FACTORTalking about public anguish over demonetisation, Madhya Pradesh CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan said that he did not see any.Chouhan said, "I go out to people every day. I did not see anyone complaining about demonetisation. No one showed anger.
Three co-accused - a priest and two nuns - surrendered before the Kerala police today in connection with the rape of a minor by a priest in Kottiyoor of Kerala's Kannur district.Fr Joseph Therakam, who is the former Wayanad Child Welfare Commitee chairman, Sister Ophilia, superintendent of Holy Infant Mary Orphanage, and another Sister Betty surrendered before the circle inspector of Peravoor today.All three who are the eighth, ninth and tenth accused surrendered following a directive from the Kerala High Court that rejected their bail plea. The High Court had asked them to surrender before March 17.ACCUSED PRIEST ARRESTED ON FEBRUARY 28The 17-year-old survivor gave birth to a child after being raped by the priest. The accused priest, identified as Father Robin Vaddakumchiryil (48), was arrested on February 28.The incident came to light after the police was informed by child-line activists following an anonymous complaint that a girl gave birth.On enquiry, the teenager, who is in standard eleventh, stated that she was raped by the priest at a church.Father Vaddakumchiryil (48), the bishop of St Sebastian church has confessed to the crime. He is the manager of the school where the girl studies.
In a severe setback to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's fight against corruption in public places and his mission to promote Digital India, the portal of the country's anti-graft watchdog Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) has not been functioning for about four months now.Sources told India Today that the hard disk of CVC's portal crashed on November 28 and all data stored online till that data has been lost. The problem has been compounded as the data was not backed up.The portal was maintained by Tata Consultancy Services (TCS). To make matters worse, CVC's contract with TCS expired in December. There is no annual maintenance contract either between CVC and TCS.The sources said after the grave tragedy, the Centre's web services organisation, National Informatics Centre (NIC), took over the maintenance of the CVC's portal this year. NIC has also been trying to retrieve the old data but without much success.All efforts to talk to senior officials of CVC such as vigilance commissioners Rajiv and TM Bhasin, secretary Nilam Sawhney, additional secretary Salim Haque and director Jyoti Trivedi were in vain.Though new complaints can now be made with CVC and their details would be available, the particulars of almost all the previous cases have been permanently erased.ALLEGATIONS OF CORRUPTION IN NTCOne of those cases pertain to alleged massive corruption in National Textile Corporation (NTC) under the Union Ministry of Textiles, now headed by Smriti Irani.Mumbai-based whistleblower HR Kosia had filed an RTI application with CVC in 2013 demanding action taken report in an alleged corruption case. He had accused NTC chairman-cum-managing director (CMD) PC Vaish of selling a godown for a song to a private party in 2013.According to Kosia's complaint, Vaish, then NTC's director, finance, had sold off Mumbai-based Poddar Process Malharvadi Kalbadevi worth crores to private builders Om Vastu Shanti for mere Rs 75 lakh. The transaction was allegedly done without due tendering process or without approval from Textiles Ministry and NTC's Board of Directors.The deal was done despite the fact that NTC had won a case against lease holder (Poddar Process) in 2013 when Vaish was finance director.Kosia, who was deputy manager (security and vigilance) with NTC, had to pay a heavy price for bringing to light this corruption and several other cases of irregularities in the Corporation. He was dismissed from service in July, 2016.Kosia's grievance is that the Textiles Ministry neither filed any chargesheet against him nor lodged an FIR nor had a 'panchnama' done.SORRY STATE OF AFFAIRS IN CVCFinally, Kosia filed an RTI in the Commission. After several communications, CVC director and Central Public Information Officer (CPIO) Jyoti Trivedi replied on December 22, 2016, saying that "due to technical problem in the working of complaint portal of the Commission, it is not possible to provide the action taken on your complaint at this stage".She added that the appellate authority in the matter was CVC additional secretary Praveen Sinha.Kosia petitioned Sinha, saying that the CPIO's response was not legally valid as per RTI Act 2005. Sinha replied to Kosia on January 24, and admitted that the "corruption case lodged with CVC required action taken reports copy".In his decision, Sinha said, "I have gone through the relevant records and find that at the time of giving a reply to the appellant (Kosia), the complaint portal was not functioning and this position was intimated to the appellant by the CPIO."I direct the CPIO concerned (Jyoti Trivedi) to confirm the position regarding complaints mentioned by the appellant in his RTI application and provide an appropriate reply to him within 15 days of the receipt of these orders," he said.Sinha further said, "The issues raised by the appellant have thus been addressed appropriately. However, if the appellant is not satisfied with the above decision, he can make an appeal with the Central Information Commission (CIC). The appeal is accordingly disposed (of)."Following the appellate authority's decision, Jyoti Trivedi sent a second reply to Kosia. In her letter dated February 9, she said, "TCS system of the Commission is still not working. It is not possible to provide the action taken on your complaints at this stage."Kosia has now made a second appeal to CIC. He also apprehends some major conspiracy behind the whole episode. "The portal crashing on November 28, CVC's contract with TCS ending just next month, no AMC either between the two and there is no back up of data - all these cannot be coincidences. There is more to it than meets the eye. The PM should have an inquiry ordered into it," he said. The fate of Kosia's application is uncertain and so does that of thousands of such cases. While the whistleblowers struggle, action against several alleged corrupt government officials may not be taken ever, dealing a severe blow to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's crusade against corruption.WATCH: Modi government has zero tolerance on corruption, says his ministerALSO READ: PM Modi thanks diaspora for supporting war against black money, corruptionNo report of RTI activist murder during last 3 years with CVC
Trapped, directed by Vikramaditya Motwane and starring Rajkummar Rao in the lead role, is in theatres this week. How good or bad is Trapped? Here is our Trapped movie review.Trapped Cast: Rajkummar Rao, Geetanjali ThapaTrapped Director: Vikramaditya MotwaneTrapped Rating:(3.5/5)Trapped. The word is onomatopoeic. You know what it means. You know the feeling. You know the helplessness. So when a man is trapped in his own house, without food, water or electricity, how does he survive? Because survive he must. On the other side of this ordeal lies his version of the Promised Land. At least what he has promised to himself: Noorie and he will have many babies. While he is haunted by the pessimistic What ifs.Director Vikramaditya Motwane gives Bollywood a fantastic albeit loopholed survival thriller in Trapped. It feels a bit weird to realise that as a director, Motwane is just two-films old... even though both of them (Udaan and Lootera) were artistic marvels in themselves. In Trapped, Motwane carries forward the legacy he seems to have inherited from the Anurag Kashyap school of filmmaking. The director's efforts shine through in every frame, in every sigh that his protagonist takes, in every moment that the viewer sits trapped inside the theatre with his/her gaze constantly travelling to the glowing EXIT sign. Trapped makes you feel trapped, but not in the way an MSG film would make you. You feel every bit helpless as Shaurya (Rajkummar Rao), who wakes up, takes his first step outside his new house, walks back in to get his mobile phone, and wham goes the door.Trapped is the story of the much-in-love-with-his-colleague Shaurya, who tries all awkward proposal techniques till Noorie (Geetanjali Thapa) goes out on a date with him. She is to get married in two months. "Arranged marriage?" Shaurya asks. She nods. Two months pass by in the blink of an eye, and two days before Noorie is to take the train home to get married, Shaurya promises to move out of his flat that he shares with three other guys, to a new home. He'll arrange everything in a day, he tells her.A shady broker catches Shaurya trying to cut a deal with other agents. He takes Shaurya to a high-rise which is yet to have residents move in. Some court-case jhamela, says the broker. All too relatable if you have had the (mis)fortune of hunting for a flat in a short period of time in a city like Mumbai or Delhi. Shaurya moves to this new flat, the door to which needs a bit of push from the outside if you want to get in. When he wakes up the next morning, there's no electricity, his phone's running out of battery, there's no water.In Trapped, Motwane captures an entire panoply of emotions on Rao's face. Rao goes from irritation to anger to helplessness to fear, dangling between hope and despair, and clutching on to dear life. There are many close-ups of Rao's face, and he nails nearly all of them. Besides the mostly taut story, Trapped relies heavily on its lead actor. And Rao throws his lot with the film. He does a fabulous job as Shaurya, adding another feather to his already-decked cap.There's a rat, there are occasional visits from pigeons. Shot in a month and inside a flat in Mumbai, Trapped tells a tale of survival peppered with the occasional humour and a few heart-in-the-mouth scenes. Therefore when the film fails to address some basic questions, you feel let down. When Shaurya goes missing, for example, there doesn't seem to be a single family member or friend or colleague concerned about his whereabouts. It's almost as if the guy exists in vacuum. You hope for some sort of answer towards the end, but there's silence there too.The runtime of the film works in its favour. In less than 2 hours, your patience levels are fine. The absence of songs makes sure the pace of Trapped is not hampered.Watch Trapped this week. Be thankful that you have the option of opening a door and getting out. And make sure you double-check the locks before that door shuts and you're, well, you know.(The writer tweets as @ananya116.)
For two months after she became the first Indian woman to be launched in space, 35-year-old Kalpana Chawla, the Karnal-born scientist, remained incommunicado. That's largely because the National Space and Aeronautical Administration (NASA), the authority that controls space flights in the US, was investigating what went wrong with one of the missions that Chawla and her five other crew members had to undertake during their 15-day space odyssey in November last year. Chawla was assigned the task of releasing Spartan, the $10 million (Rs 40 crore) solar-physics satellite from the space shuttle's bay. Either a systems malfunction or an error of judgement caused it to spin out of control and it took a daring space walk by the crew to retrieve it. NASA investigation showed it was the result of a series of small errors and absolved Chawla, calling her "a terrific astronaut". In an exclusive telephone interview from Houston, she spoke to Deputy Editor Raj Chengappa last week. Excerpts:Q. When you were first free from the clutches of gravity after lift-off, can you describe the physical and mental feeling?A. When you lift off the pressure is supposed to be maximum. But actually it was very benign. Very enjoyable. But as soon as the engines cut off and you get to zero gravity, you felt as if you were being pushed off your seat. You feel disoriented. You don't feel aligned with anything. I felt for a few good hours that I was falling. In fact, you are in a free fall- that's what zero gravity is all about. But the first few hours, the workload was so much that it was hard to realise the magic of the experience. But afterwards the feeling was literally out of this world.Q. What is the strangest thing about being in zero gravity?A. One of the strangest things is that when I was about to sleep, I realised I was only aware of my thoughts. Because you are weightless you don't feel your legs or your body. In a sense then, you are just your intelligence. It's amazing you can't feel anything but your consciousness.Q. How did you feel about becoming the first Indian woman to be in space?A. I never truly thought of being the first or second someone. Or being a small-town girl. This is just something I wanted to do. It was very important for me to enjoy it. If you want to do something, what does it matter where you are ranked? Nor does being a woman make a difference. We were all just crew members.Q. Did looking down at the earth from space change your concept of it?A. It did. The first view of the earth is magical. All of us had grown fond of watching the Himalayas pass by. I saw the Brahmaputra and how it turned to meet the Ganges. And the Ganges delta looked very serene. What is mindboggling is the tremendous speed we were going at. We crossed the Himalayas in less than two minutes, and then you realise, "Oh My God" within an hour and a half, we have gone around the whole planet. It is a very overpowering realisation that the earth is so small. The atmosphere looks like a ribbon with different colours hugging the earth. That, in addition, lends so much to its fragility. It affected me. I could not get over the notion that in such a small planet, with such a small ribbon of life, so much goes on.Q. Did you think about Karnal or India?A. We passed over India lots of times. And sometimes I would think, oh I have been there. Especially while passing over New Delhi. You couldn't really spot it but I pointed it out to my crew members and said I lived near there. But I really didn't see countries by themselves, I just saw land.Q. Does the earth look all blue from up there?A. The earth is not just a bluish hue. You actually see all the colours. It was spectacular. For example, when the Sahara comes into view, the ocean near it is an emerald green. It is shockingly beautiful. The Sahara itself looks golden brown. Then you cross the Nile, and it looks like a deep, dark green ribbon and immediately you can tell why it is the lifeline of the desert.Q. How did it affect you? A. The nice thing about it is that if there are any blemishes, it is lost. Everything looks pretty. It is as if the whole place is sacred. You get the feeling that I need to work extraordinarily hard along with other human beings to respect that.Q. Do you see the pollution?A. I did see it and it was one of the unfortunate sights. For instance, you can see smokestacks. We saw fires, one over Australia. We also saw smog layers over Taiwan.Q. Did you long for Indian food when you were up in space?A. My crewmates, especially my Japanese colleague who loves curries, would say: "How can you survive with the stuff we are eating here?" I would just laugh it off. I didn't miss it much.Q. Did you feel Indian or a sense of Indianness?A. To the contrary. On one of the night passes, I dimmed the lights in the flight deck and saw the stars. When you look at the stars and the galaxy, you feel that you are not just from any particular piece of land but from the solar system. I could extend the whole thing-maybe one day people will go to other galaxies and then what would we say? Where did we come from? I am a resident of the Milky Way?Q. What exactly happened during the Spartan satellite release manoeuvre? What malfunctioned?A. We don't know about the malfunction part. NASA is looking into all these things. It isn't one big thing but a number of small things that made us get to where we were at the end.Q. Were you hurt by some of the reports in the Indian media that blamed you?A. I just haven't had the time to look at the reports. But NASA did not blame me at all. I wasn't hurt because I figured that in the end everyone would know what the truth was.Q. What was your immediate feeling when things went wrong?A. At that time, one is so busy and focused on the task that one doesn't feel anything. My immediate feeling was that we had 13 more days to go, with plenty of experiments that had nothing to do with the satellite. This included a space walk. And we had to focus on our mission and make the best of it.Q. When you returned, what was the first thing you wanted to do?A. I wanted to go on a canoeing trip and feel the wind in my face. That's one thing you miss when you're out there. I missed the fresh air.
In the Uttar Pradesh Assembly Elections of 2017, the Samajwadi Party might have lost severely to the Bharatiya Janata Party but Rampur MLA and outgoing Urban Development Minister Azam Khan managed to win his constituency for the nineth time, that too, with a decent margin of votes. He won the constituency for the first time in 1980.?A video that shows Azam Khan rebuking two government officials, one being Rampur Sadar Sub Divisional Magistrate, has gone viral. In the video, Khan could be seen scolding the officials for making him walk through muck. Khan had gone to collect his election victory certificate but his car was stopped from entering the Rampur Mandi. Watch the video here:Annoyed that he had to walk through muck, Khan asked the officials, who could be seen hanging their heads in front of Khan, "Did Modiji instruct you to make me go through this?"

Taking a dig at the Australian media, former India cricket captain and batting legend Sunil Gavaskar on Wednesday said they should not be paid much attention as they are an extension of the team support staff. ('Disappointed' Steve Smith tags Virat Kohli's comments as 'completely wrong and rubbish')Also Watch: Can Virat Kohli's India maintain winning momentum vs AustraliaOn the Decision Review System (DRS) controversy that took centre-stage after the second Test in Bengaluru when Smith asked his teammates sitting in the dressing room balcony to help him in a leg before decision, Gavaskar said it was time, cricket became the focus.

(Hope Dhoni comes to watch the Test in Ranchi: Kumble)"There should be aggression but only in terms of cricket, not otherwise.

The Vijay Hazare trophy quarter-final between Vidarbha and Jharkhand was all about one man. Rarely has a domestic match at this venue grabbed such attendance, but with Former India skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni at the centre, all the commotion was expected. With Vidarbha managing just 159, the crowd at the Air Force Sports Complex in Palam was waiting for their hero to come out to bat. Every time a batsman got out, the crowd started chanting 'Dhoni Dhoni' but the Jharkhand skipper wouldn't oblige. There were other batsmen who needed the batting practice much more than the senior pro. Many were sitting close to the boundary ropes while many were trying to catch a glimpse of action from the boundary wall adjacent to the main road.

Come April and you won?t have to go looking for public washrooms to relieve yourself after a long day of shopping in a South Delhi market. Just walk into the nearest restaurant, convey your need to the staff and you will be able to use the well-equipped toilet for a meagre Rs 5.The South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) on Tuesday issued directions to all hotels, restaurants and eateries in its jurisdiction to make their washrooms accessible to the public from April 1. The move would allow anyone with Rs 5 in hand to access washrooms in even five-star hotels of South Delhi.According to an SDMC official, the decision has been taken on the advice of lieutenant governor Anil Baijal to explore the possibility of making toilets in restaurants and hotels open to public use.?We want the hotels and restaurants to adhere to the decision in full spirit rather than wait for the SDMC to enforce it,? said SDMC commissioner Puneet Goel.?The hotels and restaurants will also need to put up display boards informing the public about the facilities. The managements of these restaurants have been given the discretion to charge up to ~5 per usage to cover their costs towards maintenance and cleaning,? said the corporation official.The decision will be imposed on all the 4,618 eating outlets, including hotels, which are issued health trade licences by the South Delhi Municipal Corporation. ?These outlets also comprise 600 roadside eateries. However, we assume, they don?t have the provision for washrooms so, the decision doesn?t apply to them,? the official said.The move is expected to spell relief for women who have a particularly hard time for lack of enough public toilets. The civic agency is working on the modalities of the move and finalising the amount that can be imposed as penalty on defaulters. ?Since the issuance of health trade licence is at the discretion of the municipal corporation, we will add this point in its list of terms and conditions next month,? said Goel.There are 580 public urinals and 480 toilets in South Delhi. Out of 480, only 140 can be used by women. These include toilets in Lajpat Nagar, Green Park, Safdarjung Development Area, Rajouri Garden, Bhikaji Cama Place and Nehru place.

The Congress, which had fought the Uttar Pradesh election in alliance with the Samajwadi Party, won just seven of the 105 it contested, a tally lower than the Apna Dal, which won nine.

However, he admitted that Congress needed structural changes."We are in the opposition, you have ups and downs. We had a little down in Uttar Pradesh, that's fine we accept it. We had five elections, we formed the government in Punjab and won in Manipur and Goa. That is not a bad result. It is true that we lost in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand," Gandhi said. "But as far Congress is concerned we do need to make structural, organisational changes," he said, adding that Congress had an ideological fight with the Bharatiya Janata Party. Despite the humiliating loss in Uttar Pradesh, the Congress has made it clear that there was no question of vice president Rahul Gandhi stepping down."There is no question of Rahul Gandhi stepping down," veteran leader Digvijaya Singh had said?in response to media queries about a change of guard in the Congress top brass."The Nehru-Gandhi family is the greatest binding factor for the Congress and the leadership has to come to Rahul," he said.Singh, however, conceded that the Congress party needed to build regional leaders.
Mumbai, Mar 14 (PTI) Vidya Balan will be seen mouthing expletives in her upcoming film "Begum Jaan", but the actress says she was comfortable with that as it was the demand of the character. Vidya plays the role of a brothels madam in the film, set against the backdrop of freedom struggle. The action-drama is written and directed by National award winning filmmaker Srijit Mukherji and is the remake of Bengali film "Rajkahini". "All the abuses which I cant give otherwise, I said it here," Vidya joked at the trailer launch of the movie. The actress said expletives are not uncommon in that area her character comes from so they stuck with that. "The place where she comes from she abuses a lot and easily. Its no big deal. When I was playing the role there was no apprehension with regards to the language. I cant be Begum Jaan and speak shayarana Urdu." Vidya said the entire team of the film worked hard to get the perfect look for her character. "There is no contribution of mine in it (the look). Srijit had a certain vision for Begum Jaan in mind. She is from Punjab, so the costumes were made from fabrics sourced from authentic places. 
"This is a conspiracy against me. I am ready for narco test," said former Uttar Pradesh minister Gayatri Prajapati who was arrested  in Lucknow earlier today for allegedly raping a woman and attempting to rape her minor daughter."I demand that the woman and me both should be put through narco test.

(Clarke happy India, Australia resolved DRS controversy)(Also watch: Virat Kohli willing to put DRS controversy behind him)Smith was hit on the pads by an Umesh Yadav delivery during a crucial juncture of Australia's chase against India in the second Test of the four-match series. Umpire Nigel Llong upheld a loud appeal by India. (Test of maturity for Kohli and Smith in Ranchi)The Australian captain consulted his partner at the other end, Peter Handscomb before looking at the support staff. Kohli rushed to the umpire who intervened immediately and sent Smith on his way. (Hope Dhoni comes to watch the Test in Ranchi: Kumble)Later, in the post-match press conference, Kohli lashed out at his Australian counterpart and rubbished his brain fade excuse by pointing out that the visitors had tried to seek external help for the DRS a couple of times before. (Clarke, Ganguly expect aggressive cricket from Kohli, Smith)The incident threatened to snowball into a major incident between two of the most powerful cricketing nations in the world with both BCCI and Cricket Australia issuing statements in support of their captains. However, the two boards, after a joint meeting, decided to bury the issue after the International Cricket Council decided not to take any action against either Smith or Kohli. (Kumble says India won't curb aggression)On the eve of the penultimate Test, Kohli has come out to say that his team would be focused on the cricket and added that bygones should be bygones."A lot has been given into the DRS incident I feel and it's time we focus on the remainder of the series. "It's honestly what I feel because a lot of cricket is to be played and it shouldn't happen in bad taste. What's happened in Bengaluru happened in Bengaluru. "We are in Ranchi and we should look forward to tomorrow. Both teams have moved ahead from Bengaluru and I think the focus should back onto the series because the priority here is cricket," Kohli told the media on Wednesday.Kohli was understandably furious after the incident and stopped short of using the word 'cheat' after India had wrapped up victory by 75 runs in Bengaluru to level the series 1-1. However, he said did not regret his angry lashing and added for good measure that he always weighed his words."I think about what I say. I don't regret anything I say but it's very important not to be stupid and go on the same things in a daily basis. 
There seems to be no respite for filmmaker Sanjay Leela Bhansali. His upcoming film Padmavati has been under the scanner ever since the director announced the ambitious project. And after the Jaipur attack, Bhansali shifted base to Kolhapur in Maharashtra to resume the shooting of the film. But if reports are to be believed, the sets were once again attacked on Tuesday night, this time in Kolhapur. According to reports, 40-50 unidentified men tried to vandalise the sets and set it on fire. The men, armed with lathis and stones, stormed into the sets and started destroying the property. Reportedly, a few cars parked outside the sets were also damaged. "Police is probing this matter and further investigation is on. We have asked the production house to lodge formal complaint in this issue. Some one intentionally did this, that is for sure," said Deepak Kesarkar,?Minister of State for Home. It's been more than 13 hours since the incident took place but police has not got any concrete leads on this. Police is yet to identify the miscreants."It's failure on the part of government. They should take responsibility of this. Bhansali shifted venue for security reasons, but it's sad to see that the set was attacked here too. We condemn this act and demand government to nab the culprits," said, Jitendra Awhad, NCP MLA. It was only a few weeks ago that Bhansali decided to shift base to the Masai plateau, some 20km away from Kolhapur. Interestingly, the filmmaker beefed up the security after the Jaipur incident where he was manhandled by members of the Karni Sena and accused of distortion of history in Padmavati. The reason for the attack was that Bhansali was allegedly showing a romantic sequence between 14th century emperor Alauddin Khilji (played by Ranveer Singh) and Rani Padmini (played by Deepika Padukone), an incident which the Karni Sena claims had never happened in history and thus, filming the same would be an insult to the Rajputana pride.Interestingly, the filmmakers had never planned to have such a scene in the first place. Moreover, Rani Padmini is a character that was first written of in an epic poem named Padmavat by 16th century Sufi poet Malik Muhammad Jayasi. Padmini's existence is a matter of debate among historians. Meanwhile, it is reported Bhansali is safe, but the shooting of the film has been stalled till further notice. Apart from Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh, Padmavati also stars Shahid Kapoor in a lead role.(With inputs from Shivangi Thakur)

All India Bakchod funnyman Rohan Joshi was accused of molesting and sexually harassing a woman in an anonymous Reddit?post earlier today. Less than two hours later, the same person replaced that post with one that called Joshi a "great guy". What was the motive behind such a move? Read on their post to find out:Whoever this person is, disregard of what gender they come from, has single-handedly reduced a serious issue like sexual harassment to a joke. As he/she points out, the intention behind the original post (accusing Joshi of molestation) was to "expose" the woman who accused TVF CEO of sexually harassing her.Well, good job, buddy! You tricked us into believing that you were touched, groped and felt up against your consent. Of course, this is an issue that should be toyed with. Very, well done!THE ORIGINAL POSTThe Reddit user, under the pseudonym 'shadenfreude557', had claimed in the now-removed post that Joshi had tried to forcefully kiss 'her', then verbally abused and groped 'her breast' when 'she' pushed him away. It further said that they "couldn't share this experience with anyone because of the fear that no one will believe", given his celebrity status.This post was taken down less than an hour later. JOSHI'S RESPONSEWhen Twitter users drew Rohan's attention to the original Reddit post, he denied the accusation and challenged the claim saying he is "open to any investigation about this by cops or by anyone at all".@lordoftheshibs Wow. Kucch bhi. Literally. Happily open to any investigation about this by cops or by anyone at allJoshi also tweeted: I would like to state categorically that this did not happen. I am open and willing, and even urge @MumbaiPolice to investigate thisBut any competent authority who wants to investigate is welcome to, and I encourage whoever wrote that to pursue the matter earnestly.When another Twitter user brought to Joshi's attention the new Reddit post, claiming he is a "great guy", and rubbishing the sexual harassment claims, Joshi just 'sighed'. Sigh. I have no idea what is going on anymore. I think I've had enough internet for the week. https://t.co/XzggjLBlqfI still welcome any investigation, for the record. Feel free to expand it into an investigation on whether I threatened anyone even https://t.co/AxeKJMECTQTHE TVF MOLESTATION CASEThe case this blessed Reddit user was trying to expose as false is that of TVF CEO Arunabh Kumar, who has been accused of molesting multiple women.The case went viral on the social media after one former TVF employee shared her sexual harassment experience in a blog post on the Medium. As the post gained traction, a stream of charges came flooding in against Kumar with other women accusing Kumar of the same.So, our star Reddit user was trying to "expose" this anonymous woman, who posted her story under the name The Indian Fowler, by crying wolf about being sexually harassed. Smooth, eh?A word of advice, dear Reddit user. A sexual harassment case is not a football match; you don't pick your favourite side.?Also, we hope Rohan would not take this lightly and will slap a defamation case.

On Tuesday, Singh once again made a blistering attack on Nitish claiming JDU by not contesting UP polls had silently supported the BJP."Nitish is responsible for the defeat of SP-Congress alliance in Uttar Pradesh," said the senior RJD functionary.

New Delhi, Mar 14 (PTI) The RBI today told the Delhi High Court that it wants to take a fresh look into the USD 1.17 billion arbitral award granted in favour of Japanese telecom major NTT Docomo for Tata Sons alleged breach of its agreement. Justice S Muralidhar, however, did not agree with the stand taken by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), saying "there is no point in going over it all over again". "RBI has already undertaken the exercise (of looking into the award) twice over. It might be better to tell the court, whether there is any statutory provision or regulation barring transfer of money overseas under the award," the judge said. The court also said that "in every private award, RBI cannot step in" and gave the bank time till tomorrow to show the rule, regulation or circular which comes in the way of implementation of the award. Senior advocate Soli Sorabjee, appearing for the RBI, told the court that the bank would not press its application to intervene in the matter if it can take a fresh look into the award granted in favour of Docomo. This contention was opposed by senior advocates Kapil Sibal and Darius Khambata, appearing for Docomo and Tata Sons respectively. They said that on March 8, the court had asked RBI to make its stand clear by showing the rule, regulation or circular under which the banks permission is required before transfer of money overseas under the award. The lawyers for the two companies said that the RBI cannot keep it open ended by looking into afresh. 
From Sajjad Hussain Islamabad, Mar 14 (PTI) Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif today ordered authorities to take immediate action against blasphemous content on the social media and remove sacrilegious contents and punish the perpetrators, days after a high court order. "Those behind this heinous crime should be dealt with, without any delay," Sharif ordered Federal Interior Minister Chaudhary Nisar Ali Khan. "The blasphemous content on social media is a nefarious conspiracy to hurt the religious sentiments of entire Muslim ummah (community)," he was quoted as saying. He also ordered to take necessary actions in accordance with the judicial guidelines issued by the court. "Those responsible for blasphemy should be traced and punished according to the law," he said. The Islamabad High Court judge Shuakat Siddiqui last week directed the interior ministry to take actions against Facebook pages with alleged anti-Islam material. Sharif also said that accountability of those who misuse the blasphemy law for their personal interests should be ensured. He also asked the relevant departments to approach international social media platforms to put the blasphemous content off the internet. Meanwhile, Pakistans National Assembly today passed a unanimous resolution condemning the sacrilegious contents appearing on social media and agreed to constitute a ten-member committee to monitor such content. The lower house also agreed that, if required, the government should take legislative action against those posting blasphemous content on social media. 
Politicians on the right have welcomed a ruling by the EU?s highest court that allows companies to ban staff from wearing visible religious symbols, as a long-awaited legal judgment ricocheted into the French and Dutch election campaigns.In its first decision on the issue of women wearing Islamic headscarves at work, the European court of justice in Luxembourg ruled the garments could be banned, but only as part of a general policy barring all religious and political symbols.Nor can customers simply demand workers remove headscarves if the company has no policy barring religious symbols, the court ruled on Tuesday.The long-awaited ruling came on the eve of Dutch elections, where Muslim immigration has been a contentious issue. In France, where the race to succeed President François Hollande remains wide open, politicians on the right seized on the issue.François Fillon, the presidential candidate who has taken a hardline stance on Islam?s place in France, welcomed the judgment. On the day he was placed under formal investigation for misuse of public funds he said in a statement that it was ?an immense relief, not just for thousands of companies but also for their workers?. He said the ruling would be ?a factor in cohesion and social peace?, particularly in France.Gilbert Collard, an MP for the Rassemblement Bleu Marine, which supports Marine Le Pen?s Front National, claimed the ruling was an endorsement. ?Even the ECJ votes Marine,? he wrote on Twitter.In Germany, the rightwing populist party, Alternative für Deutschland, also welcomed the ruling: ?The ECJ?s ruling sends out the right signal, especially for Germany,? said the AfD?s Berlin leader, Georg Pazderski. ?Of course companies have to be allowed to ban the wearing of headscarves.?The ECJ issued a joint judgment in the cases of two women, from France and Belgium, who were dismissed for refusing to remove headscarves.?An internal rule of an undertaking which prohibits the visible wearing of any political, philosophical or religious sign does not constitute direct discrimination,? the court said.It ruled that a company?s wish to project a neutral image was legitimate and allowed internal rules banning political, philosophical or religious symbols.The first case was referred to the ECJ by the Belgian courts. Samira Achbita had been a receptionist for the Belgian branch of G4S, the London-listed outsourcing and security company when, after three years at the firm she decided she wanted to start wearing a headscarf at work for religious reasons. Achbita was fired in June 2006 for refusing to take off her scarf. The company said she had broken unwritten rules prohibiting religious symbols.In the second case, Asma Bougnaoui, a design engineer, was fired from an IT consultancy firm, Micropole, after a customer complained that his staff had been ?embarrassed? by her headscarf while she was on their premises to give advice. She had been told before taking the job that wearing a headscarf might pose problems for the company?s customers.In Achbita?s case the ECJ followed the advice of a senior legal adviser to the court, who argued that companies should be allowed to have policies banning the wearing of religious and political symbols.?The court of justice finds that G4S?s internal rule refers to the wearing of visible signs of political, philosophical or religious beliefs and therefore covers any manifestation of such beliefs without distinction. The rule thus treats all employees to the undertaking in the same way, notably by requiring them, generally and without any differentiation, to dress neutrally.?In Bougnaoui?s case the court?s adviser had ruled that she had suffered discrimination. She had been ?professionally competent? and sacked only because she had refused to remove her headscarf, the advocate general advised.The court upheld this view with a less ringing endorsement. It said customers? wishes not to be served by a worker wearing a headscarf did not give companies a get-out clause from EU anti-discrimination law. ?However, in the absence of such a rule, the willingness of an employer to take account of the wishes of a customer no longer to have the employer?s services provided by a worker wearing an Islamic headscarf cannot be considered an occupational requirement that could rule out discrimination.?The ECJ did not rule on whether Bougnaoui?s dismissal was based on her failure to observe company policies, saying this was a matter for the French court to determine.The German broadsheet Süddeutsche Zeitung predicted that the ruling would fundamentally change how German courts assess similar cases, because the assumption since 2002 had been that religious symbols could not be banned from the workplace on anything other than safety grounds. The ruling, which is more nuanced than a straightforward ban, could sow confusion about which religious symbols can be worn at work. Some legal experts said it seemed to cut against a ruling from the European court of human rights (ECHR) that allowed crosses to be worn.Steve Peers, a professor of EU law at Essex University, said the latest ECJ ruling looked awkward when set against the ECHR judgment that wearing religious symbols is ?sometimes an employee?s right to manifest freedom of religion?. He said the ECJ had not referred to this case law or attempted to deal with the distinction between freedom of religion and non-discrimination.The ECHR is the high court of the 47-member Council of Europe and not part of the EU. Traditionally, the EU court in Luxembourg confined itself to evening out distortions in Europe?s single market, but its remit has grown as EU law has expanded.The ruling prompted dismay from some religious groups. The Conference of European Rabbis, which comprises 700 Jewish leaders across Europe, said Europe was sending a clear message that its faith communities were no longer welcome. Referring to the rise of racially motivated incidents, Pinchas Goldschmidt, the group?s president, called on politicians to ensure Europe did not isolate religious minorities.Maryam H?madoun at the Open Society Justice Initiative said she was disappointed by the ruling, which she described as discrimination against people who chose to show their religion in their dress. ?It will lead to Muslim women being discriminated in the workplace, but also Jewish men who wear kippas, Sikh men who wear turbans, people who wear crosses. It affects all of them, but disproportionately Muslim women,? she said.Stephen Evans, the campaigns director at the National Secular Society in the UK, said: ?Where a ban on employees wearing religious or political symbols is founded on a general company rule of religious and political neutrality, and where that rule is applied equally to all, it can?t be realistically argued that that this constitutes ?less favourable treatment?.?Religious and political neutrality is a perfectly reasonable aim and, where businesses and organisations wish to present themselves in such a way, this ruling demonstrates that this approach is perfectly consistent with equality and human rights law.?Angelique Chrisafis contributed to this report

After Ram Gopal Varma took on Tiger Shroff and urged women to pleasure men the way Sunny Leone does, bindaas Bhidu Jackie Shroff spoke his mind on the endless controversies his Sarkar 3 (and Rangeela) director RGV has recently drowned himself in.It all began when RGV in a tweet advised Tiger Shroff to not being a 'bikini babe' and instead learn some 'machoism' from his dad Jackie.This happened on March 2, the day Tiger celebrated his birthday. When criticised for his tweets, Ramu said that his tweets were meant to be appreciative of Jackie and that his wife (and Tiger's mom) Ayesha shouldn't be taking his tweets to heart.Recently, at an event, when Jackie Shroff was asked to comment on Ramu's rather harsh words about his son, the veteran actor said, "He spoke about my son but that doesn't mean I will go and fight with him."I wish all the women in the world give men as much happiness as Sunny Leone givesFair enough. Jackie also had an interesting opinion on RGV's Women's Day tweet. Calling Ram Gopal Varma a 'big boy', Jackie said, "He is a big boy. He knows what he is talking about... But I will not say such a thing about a lady. It's his thinking."While Ramu's tweets were being seen as vile, disgusting and sexist, Tiger Shroff took RGV's criticism on a positive note. He was quoted as saying, "I am not even half the man that my father is. He is the original hero. Even if I tried, I can't be like him. But everyone has the freedom of speech. He is a senior director, so, there's not much I can say to him."

He wants to win, he hates losing and as a captain that's how he's built."One of the things I absolutely love about Virat is he's got such a deep down burning desire to win and obviously he's up to pushing the limits."The Border-Gavaskar series between India and Australia is at a stage where both teams have registered one win each with the penultimate match to be played in Ranchi from Thursday.

Vidya Balan had an apt response for a man who misbehaved with her at the Kolkata airport recently. The actor, who is currently busy promoting her upcoming film Begum Jaan, was at the airport when a man asked her if she could click a selfie with her.Till this point, everything was fine, says a report in Spotboye.com. When Vidya agreed to the selfie, she realised the man had put his arm around her. She objected to it, saying, "Don't." The man took off his arm but put it back around her again before clicking the photo.This is when Vidya lost it. The Kahaani actor screamed, "What do you think you're doing?", says the report.To this, the man pressed for a selfie yet again. An angry Vidya responded, "No, you can't! Behave yourself."When the website spoke to Vidya about this, she said, "When a stranger puts an arm around you, be it a man or a woman you get uncomfortable because they are intruding into your personal space. We are public figures, not public property."The actor was in the West Bengal capital with her Begum Jaan director Srijit Mukherji and producer Mahesh Bhatt.
Back in the summer of 2001, India were far removed from the modern-day Test giants they were - even on home soil, when a mighty Australia came to visit for a three-Test series.India, it would seem, were hardly prepared for the men from down under. They had been whitewashed 3-0 by the Aussies the previous summer and on their return home, South Africa drubbed them 2-0.There was then the one-off Test against Bangladesh and two more Tests against Zimbabwe. India managed two win two of those but not without stiff resistance from the opposition.And when the much-hyped series against Australia got underway in the March of 2001, there was little doubt who would triumph. The Aussies, led by Steve Waugh, steamrolled India in Mumbai to extend their winning streak.Things looked just as bleak in the next Test at the Eden Gardens. Australia had piled up 445 and India were knocked out for 171 and following on, were tottering at 115/3 when Rahul Dravid joined VVS Laxman in the middle. The Eden crowd was aghast. Sourav Ganguly and Sachin Tendulkar, the most established batsmen in the team, were gone and Australia were breathing fire.Laxman had shown class in his 21 Tests up until that point - few would have forgotten his 167 in Sydeny. Dravid was considered to be extremely talented but India had yet to see the flair they would go on to produce for the next decade.March 14, 2001 was when they first saw what these two could do. With their backs against the wall, India roared back as Laxman and Dravid orchestrated one of the greatest comebacks in Test cricket. They were 254/4 at stumps on day 3. When the duo resumed proceedings on the fourth day, Australia would have hoped to wrap things up quickly.
With the Bharatiya Janata Party on track to forming the next government in Goa, discontentment may be brewing among Congress leaders from the coastal state. Vishwajit P Rane, the Congress MLA from Valpoi and the leader of opposition in the outgoing Assembly, has announced he is quitting the party. Rane is also the son veteran Congressman and former Goa Chief Minister Pratapsingh Rane.An angry Rane spoke to India Today announcing his exit, slamming the way Congress failed to stitch together a majority in Goa despite emerging as the single-largest party after winning 17 seats."I am very disillusioned with the way the Goa scenario was handled is very shameful," he said. He indicated that more MLAs could follow in his footsteps, saying, "Congress MLAs are disgusted." Reacting to the news, Congress spokesperson KC Venugopal, while admitting that the Congress's strategy in Goa will have to be rethought, said, "Nobody will leave the Congress." Venugopal added that he will speak to Vishwajit about the matter.RANE SLAMS CONGRESS INACTIONBlaming Congress leaders for not moving swiftly enough Rane said that had the party accepted the demands of the Goa Forward Party, which has three MLAs, it would be sitting on the treasury benches. "Certain senior leaders should be hanged, those who scuttled the demands of the Goa Forward," Rane said.GFP went on to support the BJP, which had managed to win only 13 seats in the 40-member Goa Assembly. "(BJP leader Nitin) Gadkari could take the decision, why not our seniors?" Rane questioned. Gadkari played a vital role in ensuring that BJP formed the government. Rane, "I told Digvijay Singh (Congress general secretary) that I am done with the working of the Congress party." He went on to echo Singh's claims about money having played a role in BJP's post-poll alliance. "They (BJP) were auctioning posts for the leader of the legislative party, it was very shameful," Rane claimed. "When we were 17 we should have swiftly moved and compromises should have been made." Rane signed off, saying the post-result fiasco would cost the Congress dearly in the future. "People in my constituency say...they have blacklisted the congress party, my voters say they will not accept the Congress again." 
A mother-of-two jumped off a first-floor apartment in east Delhi on Sunday and called up the police to say she was abducted and gang-raped by five men.Cops have arrested the accused, who claim they brought the woman home for "paid sex" during a Holi party. All the men are in their twenties. Three of them work in a Noida-based BPO, while another is an engineer employed with a top IT services firm. The fifth accused was allegedly known to the woman.Officers MAIL TODAY spoke to said they are trying it ascertain if it was a "deal gone wrong" but, citing last year's Bollywood courtroom drama Pink, emphasised the importance of consent and that "no means no"."Allegedly to save herself after being gang-raped by five men, a 28-year-old divorcee and mother-of-two leapt from the first floor of a rented accommodation in east Delhi's Pandav Nagar on Sunday morning," an officer said.The definition of rape is not restricted to cases where violence is used, or where a man jumps out of the bushes and drags a woman at knifepoint down an alleyway and sexually assaults her, experts say. If one person does not consent to sexual activity and the other doesn't reasonably believe there is consent, then it is an offence.The woman reported the matter to police at around 5.30 am. "Since then, she has changed her statement twice and is unable to narrate the exact sequence of events," a senior officer said. "We are investigating the case from all angles and all five accused have been sent to judicial custody."In her statement, the woman told police that one of the suspects picked her up in his car at around 11 pm on Saturday on the pretext of dropping her to her residence in Munirka. But he brought her to a friend's house in Pandav Nagar where five of them raped her, taking turns.She said she jumped off the balcony to get away and received injuries. She was taken to east Delhi's Lal Bahadur Shastri Hospital and discharged after treatment. A medical examination confirmed rape. Officers said both the victim and accused had consumed alcohol."When cops interrogated all the accused, they claimed they knew the woman was into prostitution. On Saturday night, they called her to their house in Pandav Nagar to have paid sex for Rs 5,000 during a house party. Once the deal was fixed, one of them - who already knew her - went to pick her. But there was a dispute over money and she jumped off the building and called police," an officer close to the investigation said.Cops say the woman is unemployed and lives with her two children. Investigators are now scanning her call records and trying to gather CCTV footage.
Who will be the next chief minister of Uttar Pradesh? The question will remain a question until March 16. The Bharatiya Janata Party parliamentary board met in New Delhi today evening and announced Venkaiah Naidu and Bhupendra Yadav as observers to BJP legislative party meeting convened on March 16. The parliamentary board meeting was expected to name the leader who would be UP chief minister but the suspense will stay here for another three days.The BJP won with a massive majority in this Assembly election with 325 of the 403 seats going into its kitty. There are many contenders for the post and speculation rife in political circles.Home Minister Rajnath Singh, UP BJP president Keshav Prasad Maurya, firebrand Hindutva face Yogi Adityanath and another central minister Manoj Sinha are frontrunners but any announcement will be a surprise even to them. The decision rests with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP president Amit Shah.An hour before the announcement, Prime Minister Narendra Modi told a gathering of supporters at the BJP headquarters that a "new India" was emerging and it stood for development.He struck a reconciliatory note after a very divisive and aggressive election campaign in Uttar Pradesh when he said government was of those who voted for the BJP and also of those who did not. Putting behind the acrimony of the political campaign, PM Modi said the BJP leaders and workers were humbled by the defeat. He said when a tree bears fruit, the branches hang lower and the being trusted with power by the people should make the party act more responsibly.WATCH THE VIDEO:                                                   Also read:
After suffering a crushing defeat in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections, SP chief Akhilesh Yadav and party partron Mulayam Singh Yadav on Sunday met party workers and leaders and asked them to reach out to the people and strengthen the outfit.During the meet, Akhilesh told partymen that Samajwadi Party was not only a party, but an ideology, and that "our struggle will continue." "You all should reach out to people and strengthen the party again. I will review party's performance and analyse the results. A meeting of all the party candidates and MLAs will be held next week after which we will devise our new strategy," he said.The Samajwadi Party, which got an absolute majority in the 2012 state polls by winning 224 seats, could only win 47 seats this time despite the party's aggressive campaign against its rival BJP.Driven by the Modi wave, the BJP stormed to power in Uttar Pradesh after 14 years, securing three-fourths majority and demolishing rivals SP-Congress and BSP in the keenly-contested Assembly polls.Showing an astonishing performance, the saffron party got 312 seats in the 403-member Assembly.Watch the video here: Also read: 
Barcelona suffered a shock 2-1 defeat at Deportivo La Coruña, four days after their dramatic 6-1 Champions League win over Paris Saint-Germain. Luis Enrique?s side also lost top-spot to Real Madrid after they beat Real Betis 2-1 last night thanks to a late goal from Sergio Ramos. Zinedine Zidane?s side now lead La Liga by two points and have a game in hand over Barcelona in second. The former Real Madrid youth trainee Joselu gave Deportivo a deserved lead in the 40th minute after an error by the Barça goalkeeper, Marc-Andr?ter Stegen, although Luis Suárez equalised after 46 minutes with a powerful drilled effort.The Depor defender Alex Bergantinos headed them back in front after 74 minutes and Barcelona, who were without Neymar because of a thigh injury and clearly missed the Brazilian?s creative talents, failed to react.Suárez was denied a second equaliser by a brilliant save from Germán Lux as Baecelona suffered a first defeat in 20 league games since being beaten 4-3 at Celta Vigo, also in Galicia, on 2 October.Depor went into the game one place above the relegation zone but are on the rise under new coach Pepe Mel, who has now taken eight points in four games since succeeding the sacked Gaizka Garitano last month.The Galicians were far from intimidated by Barca?s recent run of scoring 17 goals in their previous three outings, and did not allow the champions to settle. Joselu fired a venomous shot at goal in the first real attempt for either side, forcing an outstanding save from Ter Stegen to force a corner.The German let himself down a minute later, though, letting the ball slip out of his hands from a tame shot and Joselu gobbled it up to score from close range.Barca made the ideal start to the second half as Suarez instinctively drilled a loose ball under Lux to pull level, but they could not faze the home side, who soon set about restoring their lead.Alejandro Arribas rattled the post with a header and Deportivo were wrongly given a corner, which they took full advantage of as Bergantinos outmuscled Jordi Alba to head home.?We let them get into the game for too long in the first half and this is what football is like, when you give a team an advantage they always punish you,? Suarez told reporters.?The PSG result did not cost us today, we?ve had enough days to recover. Deportivo are fighting relegation and we knew it was going to be difficult here but we?re not going to give up the fight for La Liga.?
Goa Governor Mridula Sinha today appointed Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar as the chief minister of Goa. Parrikar has been asked to prove majority within 15 days after taking oath. Parrikar will resign from his post and stake claim of the government. Swearing-in ceremony likely to be held on Tuesday. Earlier, Union Minister Nitin Gadkari confirmed that Parrikar was the BJP's chief ministerial candidate in Goa in a tweet. Parrikar, however, told the news agency ANI that he hadn't resigned yet. Parrikar said that once the BJP received an invitation, it would consult with its colleagues and pick a date for the swearing-in. On his tenure as Defence Minister, he said it was difficult since it was a new department, but added he was happy no corruption allegations were levelled against the government, ANI reported.?BJP GARNERS SUPPORT FROM SMALLER PARTIES, INDEPENDENTS The Congress, which emerged as the single largest party with 17 MLAs in yesterday's election result, was hoping that the nine non-BJP MLAs would offer it support but that was not to be. But BJP with just 13 was quick to gather support of the smaller parties and the independents. In the 40-seat Goa Assembly, a party or coalition requires support of 21 MLAs to form government. Congress has 17 MLAs and BJP only 13 but the latter cobbled together a coalition with nine out of the other 10 MLAs. GFP, MGP AND INDEPENDENT MLAs OFFER SUPPORT Three Goa Forward Party, three Maharashtravadi Gomantak Party and all three independent MLAs met BJP leaders today evening and offered their letters of support.Goa Forward Party president Vijay Sardesai came out of the meeting and announced that they had decided to support BJP to form the government under the leadership of Manohar Parrikar. With Vijai Sardesai were Rohan Khaunte and Sudin. Senior BJP leader Nitin Gadkari and Manohar Parrikar successfully persuaded them to support BJP.The Congress was confident that the independents and smaller Goa parties will come together to support a Congress government since the mandate in Goa went against the previous government. The outgoing government was a BJP government earlier led by Manohar Parrikar.Laxmikant Parsekar had replaced Parrikar as the latter was called by Narendra Modi to become the country's defence minister. Parsekar's popularity dipped soon and the party got a drubbing in the election in which Parsekar lost his own seat. BJP with the support of MGP, GFP & others have stake claim to form the Government in the state of Goa pic.twitter.com/FNyiEQygWF PARRIKAR: A POPULAR FIGURE IN GOA Manohar Parrikar, an IIT graduate, is popular in Goa and enjoys a clean image. He leads a simple life and people believe he is an honest politician where politicians are notoriously corrupt. Parrikar had earlier too expressed his desire to return to Goa because he did not like Delhi, particularly its food didn't agree to his palate used to Goan fish recipes.Congress's Digvijaya Singh called it a political coup and accused the Bharatiya Janata Party of horse-trading. The BJP rubbished the allegations saying the independent MLAs and those of smaller parties did not wish to support the Congress.PARRIKAR'S CABINET Sources say all Goa Forward Party and Maharashtravadi Gomantak Party MLAs will be made ministers in the government. At least two independent MLAs including Rohan Khaunte would also get ministerial berths. The Speaker and Deputy Speaker of the Assembly will be from the Bharatiya Janata Party.

New Delhi, Mar 10 (PTI) The Income Tax Department has received responses from 8.38 lakh persons out of the 18 lakh SMS/email queries it had sent to 17.92 lakh people for suspicious deposits post demonetisation. "More than 12 lakh responses have been received from 8.38 lakh distinct PANs/persons which are under verification," Minister of State for Finance Santosh Kumar Gangwar said in a written reply in the Lok Sabha. The tax profiles of 17.92 lakh people were "not in line" with the cash deposits made by them during the 50-day demonetisation period. Under the Operation Clean Money launched on January 31, the I-T department sought online response on source of cash deposited by these persons. The government had on November 8, 2016, demonetised 500 and 1,000 rupee notes and asked holders of such currencies to deposit them in bank accounts by December 30. "In case explanation of source of cash is found justified, the verification is closed. The verification is also closed if the cash deposit is declared under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana," Gangwar said. He said an appropriate action in non-compliant cases is taken as per law, which includes searches, surveys, assessment of income, levy of taxes, penalties and filing of prosecution complaints in criminal courts. In a separate reply to a question in the Lok Sabha, Gangwar said during April 1, 2014 to December 31, 2016, the I-T department conducted searches in 1,838 groups of assessees, seizing undisclosed assets worth Rs 2,607 crore. These assessees admitted to undisclosed income of Rs 33,210 crore. During the same period, the department conducted 14,472 surveys that resulted in detection of undisclosed income of Rs 31,929 crore. 
That Huma Qureshi is a class apart is known throughout the industry. Not only is she classy externally, she's actually classier on the inside. Huma was recently part of a big Indo-British movie called Viceroy's House that also starred Hugh Bonneville. In fact, she was also at the BRIT Awards this year for the same, but did you hear anyone make a big pump and show about it? No, right? That's class, right there.But that's besides the point. The point here is that Huma has faced a lot of negativity in the industry for being "different". She's a couple of sizes bigger than most actresses in Bollywood, and frankly, that's what makes her so beautiful and elegant. Some people, however, fail to see that. And Huma is making a point about exactly those people in a new ad she's starred in, and might we add, is looking super hot in:You keep trying to put me down .. say rubbish.. I will keep raising the bar #DownNaysayers #IShapeMyWorld @levis_in @levisA post shared by Huma Qureshi (@iamhumaq) on Mar 9, 2017 at 6:19am PSTAnd what Huma says in the ad has us all pumped and proud of our own bodies: "Being an actor is I think the most vulnerable space you can be in, everyone has an opinion. A lot of people make these sexist comments in passing every single day without realising the damage they're causing. Body shaming is as harmful as anything else; as an actor you just have to have a really thick hide. Someone wrote a really nasty review about the film I did, and they also said Huma Qureshi is 5 kilos too heavy to be a mainstream heroine. There are only two ways to deal with a bully, no, either you stop crossing paths?or you give it back to the bully, because ultimately bullies are just really, really insecure people who basically are projecting their own sense of self worth onto the outside world.Whoever I am today is because of the fact that I'm an outsider, because I don't fit in. Who wants to blend in when they can stand out? I am Huma Qureshi and this is how I shape my world."  
Manohar Parrikar was today appointed the chief minister of Goa by the state's Governor, Mridula Sinha. Parrikar will step down from the post of Defence Minister. After garnering support from independent candidates and small parties, the BJP now claims the support of a total of 22 MLAs in Goa. Latest Developments:We met the Governor, expecting an invitation.Once we receive it,we will consult our colleagues and decide the date for swearing in: Parrikar pic.twitter.com/r3mpCAMLdpBJP HAS A PLAN?With some votes still to be counted, BJP president Amit Shah announced in New Delhi yesterday that the BJP was in a position to form government in Goa. This gave an idea that the BJP has a plan for Goa.READ| Goa Assembly Election 2017 Detailed ResultWhen the final tally was known, the Congress emerged as the single largest party with 17 seats in the 40-member Goa Assembly. The ruling BJP secured 13 seats, eight less than the 2012 Goa Assembly election.Chief Minister Lakshmikant Parsekar lost to Congress candidate Dayanand Sopte, who visited party office as a 'giant killer'.But, the BJP still claimed that it was in a position to form government. How?Sources in the BJP and political observers, both, are of the view that the answer lies in Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar.WHY PARRIKAR AGAIN?In the 40-seat Goa Assembly, a party or coalition requires support of 21 MLAs to form government. Chief Minister Parsekar has lost the election. He was anyway considered a weak candidate than his predecessor Parrikar. The final tally has 10 seats under the belt of non-BJP, non-Congress parties. The Maharashtra Gomantak Party has been a former ally of the BJP and during Parrikar's regime the two parties worked in harmony.Speaking to India Today MGP leader Sudin Dhawalikar said, "We have passed a resolution to support the BJP only if Manohar Parrikar is made the Chief Minister."WATCH| Assembly election results 2017: How counting day unfolded in GoaDhawalikar also said, "We have written a letter to (BJP president) Amit Shah to consider our request."Quite interestingly Dhawalikar claimed that other non-Congress players are also ready to support the BJP with Parrikar as CM. "I have also spoken to Goa Forward party and they too will support if Parrikar is made the Chief Minister. The NCP too is willing to join us," Dhawalikar told India Today.IS PARRIKAR WILLING?Late last night after the results were announced, Parrikar said, "In the situation of a fractured mandate, everyone is in the run to form the government. We are also there. If the BJP acts like a core group and brings together smaller parties, we can still give a stable government."Parrikar said exactly on the same lines as the MGP leader would tell India Today some 12 hours later.Parrikar went on to add, "BJP is in the best position to form the government. I am confident of getting necessary support."??Tarun Khanna,12 Mar 2017

Ajay Devgn is not really a new player in Marathi cinema. Back in 2014, the Shivaay actor was the producer of the Marathi period film Vitti Dandu directed by Ganesh Kadam.Now, according to a report in Mumbai Mirror, Ajay Devgn has teamed up with Abhinav Shukla and actor Nana Patekar to produce a Marathi film, to be directed by Satish Rajwade. The film is touted to be a thriller and will star Nana as the hero."It's a thriller which revolves around Nana's character. It will also feature a few other leading Marathi actors with whom we are in talks with. I've been discussing the film with Abhinav for over a year now. We've always wanted to work together and I'm happy to be collaborating with him. Ajay and Nana are superstars and I'm really excited to be working with such powerhouse talents," Satish was quoted as saying. He has directed films like Premachi Goshta, Ti Saddhya Kay Karte and Mumbai Delhi Mumbai.Nana Patekar and Ajay Devgn has co-starred in several films such as Bhoot, Apaharan and Rajneeti. The last Marathi film Nana was a part of was Natsamrat directed by Mahesh Manjrekar. The film revolved around an aging stage actor, played by Nana Patekar, who could not forget theatre."In Marathi cinema, content is the king and I'm happy that so many actors from Hindi cinema are showing a keen interest. We will start shooting by the middle of the year and we are still scouting for the right locations," Satish added.
The BJP achieved a landslide victory in the Uttarakhand assembly elections 2017. The Uttarakhand Assembly election results are in and show that the incumbent Congress government has been completely decimated. With a negative voter sentiment towards incumbent chief minister Haris Rawat, it comes as no surprise that the saffron party has won a whopping 57 seats in the hill state. While BJP spokesperson for Uttarakhand was quick to say that Rawat's defeat was the rejection his leadership, Rawat on the other hand conceded defeat."I accept the defeat of Congress. My leadership may not have been up to the mark and resulted in the party's failure," said Chief Minister Harish Rawat.While the Congress still managed to win some seats, the Mayawati-led Bahujan Samaj Party was completely decimated in the Uttarakhand assembly election.NO TRACE OF BSPMayawati-led Bahujan Samajwadi Party proved the axis poll predictions right as they were entirely decimated in the Uttarakhand Assembly election. 637 candidates including 56 women contested in 70 seats of the Uttarakhand Assembly.
For the first time in recent history, Punjab witnessed a three-cornered fight for its 117-seat Assembly. Counting began at 8 am at 54 centres in 27 locations where the state election commission had deployed more than 14,000 officials.?The Congress took a lead since the very first trend, and continued the momentum to outrun its competition. The party has come close to winning a two-thirds majority in the Punjab Assembly and with at least 69 seats in its bag, Congress is far ahead of the likely second-placed Aam Aadmi Party. The ruling Shiromani Akali Dal-Bharatiya Janata Party, which exit polls had predicted wouldn't even reach double digits, put a better showing than expected. While it took leads in more than 20 seats in the morning, its lead was cut back once the results started becoming clearer. Incumbent Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal has conceded defeated and has said he will offer his resignation to the governor tomorrow. Meanwhile, Congress's Captain Amarinder Singh will have a very memorable 75th birthday today as the veteran leader prepares to head the new government in what is going to be his last political innings. Singh, who has said this is the last time he is contesting an election, lost to Badal in Lambi, but comfortably won from his home seat of Patliala (Urban).?Here is all that happened: 
Six out of 10 Assembly seats in Amethi and Raebareli parliamentary constituencies -- long considered Congress strongholds -- have gone to the BJP while two went to the Samajwadi Party, leaving the grand old party gasping with just two.A beaming Amit Shah, the BJP President, in his first media comments after the party's grand success in the state elections, drew specific attention to its performance in the twin Lok Sabha constituencies, held by party chief Sonia Gandhi and her deputy and son Rahul.It was a complete washout for the Congress in Rahul's Amethi Lok Sabha constituency, comprising the assembly seats of Amethi, Tiloi, Jagdishpur, Gauriganj and Salon. The party managed to win two of the five assembly constituencies of Sonia Gandhi's Raebareli Lok Sabha seat -- Raebareli and Harchandpur -- while losing Sareni, Bachhrawan and Unchahar.In Rahul's constituency, the Congress managed to come in at second spot in Jagdishpur, Gauriganj and Salon, was beaten to third spot in Tiloi and came in a miserable fourth in Amethi itself.In Sonia's constituency, the party came in at No.2 in Bachhrawan, No.3 in Sareni and a distant fourth in Unchahar.In the prestigious Amethi constituency, the erstwhile "queen" of the local principality Garima Singh of the BJP defeated SP's rape-accused absconding minister Gaytri Prasad Prajapati. Congress candidate Ameeta Singh, the current "queen" and wife of senior leader Sanjay Singh, came in a poor fourth behind the BSP candidate."Of 10 seats, we won six seats by big margins and this is making us very happy. We didn't do well here in 2014. But from now, politics will take a new direction in Uttar Pradesh," Shah said.Also read:Uttar Pradesh Election Results: Narendra Modi leads BJP's landslide win after 14 years

New Delhi, Mar 10 (PTI) The government and the industry should share responsibility for creating an environment that fosters innovators and helps them take ideas to the market, eminent industrialist Ratan Tata said today. "I believe responsibility of private sector is as much to encourage these innovations because it is outside sphere of a normal banking arrangement to see innovation being funded and so I believe under the auspices of the President and the Department of Science and Technology (DST) are looking at very important moment in our history," Tata said. Tata was speaking at a round-table on start-ups, incubation and financing innovations at the Rashtrapati Bhavan today. The government and the industry should share responsibility for creating an environment in the country that fosters and recognises innovators and helps them take ideas to the market, Tata said. "It is great privilege and great honour to be here today as someone who is been in the start-up and the ... innovation sector and to be aware that today at the highest level in the country, we are receiving the kind of attention that we should have received many many years ago," Tata said at the concluding day of the Festival of Innovations. Tata said start-ups and innovation are recent terms which connote enormous profits, billionaires but people often forget both innovation and start-ups have resulted in products and assistance for common good of man. "India has been country which has created many innovators many of who have to go abroad to fulfil their dreams," Tata said. President Pranab Mukherjee also expressed concern over funding methodology for innovative start-ups and called for urgent need to rethink on design and structure of financial instruments to provide a fillip to grass root innovation movement. 
Firebrand BJP MP Yogi Adityanath has said that the massive mandate people of Uttar Pradesh have given the party in the Assembly election indicates that voters have rejected the Samajwadi-Congress combine and Bahujan Samaj Party's politics of appeasement of Muslims."BJP's campaign was full of positivity but those by the SP-Congress alliance and BSP focused on Muslims' appeasement. The mandate clearly shows that people have rejected appeasement politics", said Yogi Adityanath.Taking a jibe at Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, Adityanath said that it was the alliance which the former stitched with Congress that helped them win whatever few seats they have finally got."It was the alliance which Samajwadi Party forged with Congress that ensured them win a respectable number of seats in the election", he said. RAM TEMPLE WILL BE BUILT SOON: ADITYANATH ?On the contentious issue of construction of Ram Mandir in Ayodhya, Yogi indicated that the temple would be built soon after the BJP government is formed in Uttar Pradesh."Ram Mandir is definitely on our agenda. Whatever we have promised in our manifesto, we will deliver on those points", the BJP MP added.Finally, on the issue of who will the chief minister of UP be, Adityanath kept everyone guessing, stating that he was not in the race for the top post."I am not a contender for the chief minister's post. I will abide by the BJP parliamentary board's decision on the choice of the next chief minister", he said.Also read | BJP's tsuNaMo in Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand; Congress set to win Punjab: 10 big takeawaysWeb Exclusive Result TV With Rahul Kanwal
London, Mar 10 (PTI) The worlds oldest known crocodile eggs laid some 152 million years ago have been discovered in the cliffs of Portugal. The remarkably well preserved eggs give an insight into the "mother croc" that laid them, researchers said. They are similar to the eggs of modern crocodiles, suggesting crocodile eggs have changed little in shape in the last 150 million years. Palaeontologists say the prehistoric crocodile ancestor would have spanned two metres, based on the size of the larger eggs. "The fact that they are from the Late Jurassic makes these eggs the oldest crocodilian eggs known so far," said Joao Russo of Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Portugal. "This new discovery from Portugal extends the knowledge of this type of egg by approximately 40 million years," said Russo. Crocodilians arose some 200 million years ago, when they prowled the land with early dinosaurs. 
Infosys, the Bangalore-based software trailblazer, created history on March 11 by becoming the first Indian-registered company to list on Nasdaq, one of the two major stock exchanges in the US.Technically, however, Infosys is the second Indian company to list on Nasdaq, since the $30 million (Rs 126 crore) US-registered but wholly Chennai-domiciled Cognizant Technology Solutions listed in June 1998. Now the doors are open and we could expect to see at least 10 Indian information technology (IT), pharmaceutical and telecom companies follow Infosys' example over the next two years. By global standards, however, India's presence on Nasdaq will be modest. Some 80 Israeli companies and a good number of companies from Australia, Argentina and South Africa are also on Nasdaq.Nasdaq itself was launched in 1971. Although the most widely-tracked indicator of stock market health, the Dow, is based on its rival New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), close to 60 per cent of the total share volume and listed companies in the US is on Nasdaq. It is the popular perception that it is an exchange predominantly for IT companies, since its stars have been names like Microsoft, Intel, Oracle and Netscape.Actually, less than 20 per cent of the listed companies are in the IT industry. The bulk are in pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, banking, telecom, electronics, oil, transportation and housing. By and large, Nasdaq is home to new, first-generation, technology-driven companies. Already around 20 IT companies founded by Indian-Americans with a total market capitalisation of around $16 billion - like i2 Technologies, Microchip Technologies and Mastech - are listed on it.It is to Infosys' credit that it has been diligently following American accounting principles for the past few years so as to make its debut on Nasdaq easy. The fact that it is a professionally-owned, one-industry company of relatively new vintage helped. Over 80 per cent of its revenues are generated in North America.But a large majority of established, family-owned Indian companies will have to rework their accounts if they wish to seek listing in the US. The American standards are ruthless. In 1993, Daimler-Benz listed on the NYSE. Its reported profit of $370 million under German rules got converted into a $1 billion loss by American standards.This is not so in India. Second, unlike India, the US requires all deferred taxes to be recorded. Third, unlike the US, India allows excess depreciation and provides a choice to the company on the method to be adopted for calculating the depreciation charge.Fourth, unlike the US, the Indian standard recognises the revaluation of fixed assets. Fifth, US accounting standards require gains or losses from foreign currency transactions to be included in determining net income. There are other differences as well - for example, the US does not allow proposed dividend to be accrued and requires current portion of long-term debt to be shown as current liability.The London-based International Accounting Standards Committee, a private-sector body of which the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India is a member, has been pursuing the cause of core, uniform norms to be adopted around the globe. 
Finally, a respite for students struggling with their Class 10th and 12th exams. A temple in Gujarat has come to the aid of school students grappling with their board exams. Funny as it may sound, this temple is offering a pen set that can solve all life's problem for students in distress.A shabbily designed hand bill issued by the Kashthabhanjan Temple in Gujarat's Panchmahal district has gone viral on social media raising many eyebrows as well as triggering mirthful comments.Dushyant Bapuji, who identifies himself as a Hanuman sevak, has said in the handbill that this pen was made using the divinity acquired by performing a Hanuman Saraswati Yagya.Comments ranged from calling it farce to youth self-assured posts like, "brilliant, now play and have fun throughout the year and by Bapuji's pen for exams."The handbill with all its loud typography also attempts to capitalise on the sentiments of parents by asking pertinent questions like - Do you want your child to pass his exams? Are you worried that your child may lose a year due to poor results? Do you wish your child passes his Class 8,9, SSC, HSC or College exams?Well, the magic pen set, that is believed to relieve stress and push young prodigies to threshold of success, comes at a whopping price of Rs 1,900.The makers of the pen sets also assure a payback if the student fails his examination. "If your student does not pass his examinations even after using our pen set, then we will return the entire amount," read a note in Gujarati in the handbill. The 100 per cent guarantee is written in bold letters at the top of the handbill, which also features a photograph of the incredible inventor.The authorities have also ensured that the invention does not fall into the wrong hands. A note in the handbill also mentions a mobile number, exam receipt, a photocopy of hall ticket and copy of school/college ID as prerequisites to buy the pen set.Also read:CBSE Board Exam 2017 begins today: Mobile app launched to locate exam centreCBSE Class 10 Board Exam: Assessment scheme revised

New Delhi, Mar 10 (PTI) There are 74 missing defence personnel, including 54 prisoners of war, believed to be in Pakistani jails, the government has said. In a written reply to a question in the Rajya Sabha yesterday, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj said the government has repeatedly taken up the matter with the Pakistan government through diplomatic channels and during high-level contacts for the release of Indian PoWs believed to be in Pakistan. However, Pakistan does not acknowledge the presence of any Indian PoW in its custody, she added.

Ram Gopal Varma might have apologised for his sexist tweet on Sunny Leone this Women's Day, but the filmmaker has found a supporter in Rakhi Sawant. When many celebrated the women in their lives, this Women's Day, RGV said that every woman should know how to keep men happy just like Sunny Leone.? And this very tweet invited the wrath of many. But Rakhi says that she completely supports RGV and says that "every woman should learn to give pleasure."Talking to media, Rakhi said, "Whatever Ram Gopal Varma said is right. I am with him, where he has praised Sunny Leone. I would also like to say that every woman, as said by Ram Gopal Varma, should learn to give pleasure.""Women should let go their responsibilities of kitchen and should take coaching classes on how to give pleasure," she added. This has come a day after RGV apologised for his distasteful tweet. The filmmaker issued an apology saying that he didn't mean to be insensitive but also categorically mentioned that he was not apologetic to those who were "attacking" him. Rakhi also added that RGV shouldn't have apologised for his tweets, "Whatever he has said is true and I support him. A man lives with his wife for so many years, the wife serves him throughout her life and the moment a young, hot girl enters the man's life, he forgets his wife."ALSO READ: Ram Gopal Varma wishes all women to make men happy like Sunny Leone does

A six-month-old medical report from a mohalla clinic in Delhi showing an abnormally high blood sugar level of 9,481.7 mg/dl for a patient, has gone viral on social media.The normal level is usually less than 140 mg/dl, post meals.The AAP government, which runs the clinics, has however dismissed the report as ?forged?, saying such messages are being spread to discredit the mohalla clinic system.The HbA1c test result, which measures the average blood glucose level over a period of time, shows the glucose levels of the patient are 332%, whereas a healthy person should have below 6%.This report resurfaced on Twitter on Friday, days after Delhi?s vigilance team started investigation into mohalla clinic doctors, calling patients for unnecessary follow-ups.Twitterati went berserk with comments, blaming doctors and the labs for botched tests and treatment.?OMG!!! This is shocking. (Arvind)?Kejriwal ji PM ki degree ko chodo, zara mohalla clinics ke doctors ke bhi degree check karo (Kejriwal, forget the PM?s degree, check the degrees of the doctors of mohalla clinics),? read a tweet from the account of Pune-based Dr Majboor Gulati.Delhi government?s health department officials, however, said that the report is most likely a fake one as there have been cases of forging reports in the past.?I have not seen the report. However, a similar report had been doing the rounds on social media last year and we found that it had been forged using stationery from the labs,? an official said, adding that labs have been asked to be careful about their stationery.Noting that the mohalla clinic system, which provides consultation, medicine and tests, has benefitted several people, the official said these messages are being spread to discredit the system.He also said that even if such a report a came from their labs, there is a doctor to check it. ?And, the doctor would never treat based on such a test report they would resend the samples.?Last year, BJP MLA Vijender Gupta had questioned the quality of healthcare provided at mohalla clinics, citing the example of a pregnant woman who was diagnosed with thalassemia at one clinic and the report was allegedly incorrect according to a private lab.?A D-10 haemoglobin electrophoresis by Bio-Rad, the accepted golden standard test, was performed for the woman and she was found to be carrying thalassemia trait,? an official had informed HT.Carrying the trait does not mean that a person is suffering from thalassemia, but, if the husband also carries the gene, there are 25% chances that the baby suffers from the genetic blood defect, the official explained.
Days after the killing of an Indian fisherman allegedly by the Sri Lankan Navy, the country today released 53 fishermen."53 fishermen have been released from Jaffna jail while 32 others are still in custody in Vuvuniya jail," Fishery Ministry officials said.Sri Lanka had earlier informed the Indian High Commission in Colombo that it will release all 85 Indian fishermen in their custody, External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Gopal Baglay said.Sri Lanka and India on Wednesday agreed to release fishermen held in each other's custody after a high-level discussion between the two sides in Colombo in a bid to defuse the tension following the killing of an Indian fisherman.A 22-year-old fisherman from Tamil Nadu was killed and another injured on March 6 allegedly by the Sri Lankan Navy.

New Delhi, Mar 9 (PTI) 34 cabin crew members, including 30 air hostesses, of Air India are grounded for being "obese", the government said today. Currently, the total strength of cabin crew in the national carrier stands at 3,490. "At present, 34 cabin crew (30 female and 4 male) are grounded due to high Body Mass Index (BMI)," Minister of State for Civil Aviation Jayant Sinha said in a written reply in Lok Sabha. As per the DGCA guidelines the maximum BMI for women is 22 while for men it is 25. "Therefore, cabin crew who are in obese category are grounded to enable them to attain the prescribed limits," he said. Sinha further said, "Air India provides enough opportunity to cabin crew to reduce their weight. Once the cabin crews are out of obese category, they are taken back for flying duties." 
Former Pakistan leg spinner Danish Kaneria, serving a life ban on charges of spot-fixing has appealed to the cricket authorities to have his case revisited by the inquiry tribunal set-up to probe into the allegations against Pakistani batsmen, Sharjeel Khan and Khalid Latif.The PCB had earlier announced a three-member tribunal headed by former Lahore high court judge, Asghar Haider to hold proceedings against Sharjeel and Khalid.The other members of the tribunal include former Chairman of the board, Lt General (retd) Tauqir Zia and former test captain, Wasim Bari."I have been saying all along that the anti-corruption panel of the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) imposed the life ban on me based on the statement of my Essex teammate Mervyn Westfield, who himself has told lies about me and had to be forcibly summoned to attend the hearings," Kaneria told PTI on Thursday.Kaneria said his case was heard and decided in the United Kingdom and his lawyers and he remained unsatisfied with the way the hearings were heard."No one listened to us, lot of anomalies in the statements of Westfield against me were ignored. I didn't get justice," he said.The leg-spinner was banned for life in June 2012 by the ECB's anti-corruption tribunal on allegations of trying to convince his Essex teammates into spot-fixing in county matches.

At a time when the police is considered dishonest and the person donning the uniform often compromising with his duty, a police officer in Darbhanga has set an example. Prabhat Shankar Singh, who is posted as Inspector at APM Police station, on Thursday put his job as a policeman first and got his son arrested on charges of liquor smuggling.Indrajeet, the son of the police officer, had lately joined a group of liquor smugglers ahead of the festival of Holi. He had smuggled 25 bottles of foreign liquor into Bihar to sell it at a high price in order to make a huge profit, but before he could succeed with his plans, his father came to know about it. 
West Bengal Education Minister Partha Chatterjee today said that around 100 schools were show caused following allegations of attempt to influence innocent minds through teachings that might promote religious intolerance. The minister told the Assembly that the government had taken note of such activities taking place in some schools, particularly in parts of north Bengal and North 24-Parganas district in south Bengal. Chatterjee said that Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, in her capacity as the Home minister, had also given him a list of some schools allegedly indulging in such activities and after due process the "no objection certificate" (NOC) of some of these institutions were cancelled. Warning that the government would not allow any attempt to promote religious intolerance through teachings in some private schools, the minister said that educational institutions would have to adhere to the syllabus of the board to which these are affiliated. Chatterjee points out that many of these private schools get affiliation from different central boards of education and then take an NOC from the state, making it difficult for the state to directly act against them. The minister was replying to a question on steps being taken by the state government over reports of some private educational institutions teaching outside their syllabus and curriculum with some hidden religious agenda.

The Delhi government will bear the expenses of treatment in private hospitals to people injured in road accidents, and victims of burns and acid attacks.The move is expected to purge the problem of most private hospitals allegedly turning away accident patients to government hospitals over payment issues.?Our aim is to save as many lives as possible. Precious hours are lost when police commute long distances to take the victims to a government hospital,? Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain said.The government has selected about 230 private hospitals in the city, which have more than 20 beds, intensive care units, and equipped to deal with emergency cases such as road accidents and burns.?Most often private hospitals either don?t admit road accident victims or simply stabilise the patients before sending them off to a government hospital. They do this because they are unsure about who would pay for the treatment. We will,? Jain said.The scheme will be available from the next two or three days.The government will foot the bill for emergency aid, surgeries and two-week hospital stay in economy or similar budget-category beds and wards.?If the patient needs to stay in hospital for a longer period, the regional director of health services can extend the benefit,? the health minister said.The only condition is that the accident should happen within New Delhi.Private hospitals must provide details of all road accident, burns and acid attack victims under their care within 12 hours of admitting them. The patient?s papers, including medico-legal documents, should be submitted to the government to get the free treatment.
Refusing to give "an opinion on opinion polls", Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi today rejected the various exit polls that gave the BJP a clear lead in Uttar Pradesh and claimed his alliance with the Samajwadi Party is winning the state."We will win in Uttar Pradesh.

Electric shocks, gas leaks and a horrific stampede?that?s what got served on the last day of Hansraj college?s annual cultural fest Confluence 2017. The fest?s finale was much-awaited, owing to the appearance of singer actor Diljit Dosanjh, but sadly, it did not end well for the crowd and Dosanjh.The singer who had to appear onstage at 5 in the evening had thousands of fans waiting for him at the college grounds since 2 in the afternoon. The singer-actor finally came onstage around 7pm. The excited crowd had already broken barricades, stormed the sides of the stage and had to be repeatedly told to maintain decorum by Diljit?s team and the college authorities.A view of the crowd that had come to see Diljit?s performance at the fest.							(Manoj Verma/HT?Photo)						By the time Diljit finally came on stage, the crowds had mostly gathered around the stage, breaching almost every level of security possible. The singer urged the crowd to maintain decorum and promised to give them a great performance if they supported him; only to stop mid song and ask a bunch of students near the stage to move back. ?Meri sab to sincere request hai, picche ho jaao. Dilli sayyano da sheher haiga, sayyano waali gal kariye aapa. Masi masi mauka milda show karan da tussi pls hon do properly (I request everyone to move away from the stage.

Not often do we get a chance to do such a big show, please let it happen properly),? said the singer.Singer Diljit Dosanjh repeatedly urged his fans to maintain decorum and let the concert happen properly..							(Manoj Verma/HT?Photo)						However, in an effort to not disappoint the crowd, Dosanjh sang a few hit songs. It was when he was singing his hit Veer Vaar  that a leak occurred in a cylinder near the stage and the audience was asked to evacuate the area, which resulted in a stampede. A nearby firework station fell, too, causing a few to suffer mild electric shocks. Dosanjh too had to be escorted to his vehicle, eventually having to leave the venue. Arjun Nath, a student at the venue badly bruised his leg; Risheeta Malik (name changed on request) was groped and pushed around by a group of guys and Karan Singh from IP university had to seek medical help as he fell and twisted his ankle. Shubam Rawat, another student from IP university and Karan?s friend said, ?It is unfortunate that this happened. Delhi doesn?t deserve to have such big artists perform for them. They are a bunch of rowdy hooligans.? Members of Pagg, a dance team which had come all the way from Amritsar were also disappointed and said, ?We love Diljit paaji and we are glad at least he is safe. But, show da ki faida jidech saadi jaan nikal jaaugi. Saa kad ta logaan ne.? SRK had come to the college before too, but the organisers listened to us and despite the huge crowd, everything went well. What happened here is a clear case of mismanagement and ignorance on the behalf of the organisersPolice officials claimed that they had warned event managers to not keep fireworks or cylinders around the stage, but despite warnings, they did not change the setup. ?SRK had come to the college before too, but the organisers listened to us and despite the huge crowd, everything went well.

I really love my fans and was really happy to see such massive turn out of the show. It?s quite unfortunate that this incident happened and situation became uncontrollable . I hope to see my Delhi fans soon,? he said.
A new statue of a resolute young girl staring down Wall Street's famous Charging Bull was erected by a major asset managing firm for International Women's Day to make a point: There's a dearth of women on the boards of the largest US corporations.State Street Global Advisors, the Boston-based investment giant, had the statue created to push companies to increase the number of women directors.Artist Kristen Visbal's "Fearless Girl" drew crowds Wednesday that initially came to pose for pictures with the bull, but the novelty quickly became a New York hot spot.The girl is sculpted in bronze, her hands firmly planted on her waist, ponytailed head held high."Know the power of women in leadership. SHE makes a difference," reads a plaque at her feet."As a steward of nearly $2.5 trillion of assets, we want to engage with boards and management around issues that we think will drive core results," said Lori Heinel, State Street's deputy global chief investment officer. "And what you find repeatedly is having more diverse boards and more diverse senior management will actually drive better results for companies."According to ISS Analytics, a business research firm, just 16 per cent of board seats on companies in the Russell 3000 are held by women; the average board of directors has eight men and one woman."It's going to happen to the end of time unless you change something," says Erik Gordon, a lawyer and professor at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business. "It's got to not just be the rules. It's got to be the culture."State Street has three women on an 11-member board. Heinel said her company also will urge those in Great Britain and Australia to add women to their leadership.One man working in corporate America needed no convincing.Chandrasekar Sundaram says a woman is the CEO of the company he works for in Texas, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, and has quite a few women reporting to her."But when it gets to 50 per cent, that's when I think it'll be right," said Sundaram, a Dallas resident and native of India who was visiting New York with his family - with the Charging Bull as one of their stops.The mammoth bronze was a "guerrilla art" act, dropped in the middle of the night in Bowling Green Park in 1989 without permission, by an artist who created it as a symbol of Americans' survival energy following the 1987 stock market crash. The city gave its permission for the bull to remain.This week, McCann New York, a top advertising agency, installed the statue of the girl before dawn Tuesday - with a city permit for one week. Negotiations are underway for the piece to remain longer.
From K J M Varma Beijing, Mar 8 (PTI) Chinas Parliament has given its approval to President Xi Jinpings elevation as the "core leader", reinforcing his hold over all the organs of power, ahead of his second five-year tenure. The core leader status, that had been earlier been approved by the ruling Communist Party, puts 63-year-old Xi at par with party founder Mao Zedong, his successor and reformist leader Deng Xiaoping and elevates him to a higher status above others in the Communist Party of Chinas (CPC) collective leadership system. Chinas top legislator Zhang Dejiang pledged further conformity to the CPC Central Committee with Xi as the core, state-run Xinhua news agency reported today. National lawmakers should unite more closely "around the CPC Central Committee with Xi Jinping as the core," to develop the system of the peoples congress and realise the dream of national rejuvenation, Zhang, the chairman of the National Peoples Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, said while delivering a work report of the NPC Standing Committee. The endorsement of Xi as the core "reflects the will of all members of the Party, all members of the armed forces and all the people of China," Zhang told the nearly 3,000 NPC deputies gathered at the Great Hall of the People. NPC is often referred by the foreign media as a rubber stamp parliament for routinely approving CPCs proposals. The legislature, along with advisory body -- Chinese Peoples Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) -- are currently holding their annual sessions set to end on March 15. Zhangs remarks of Xi being the "core leader" was echoed by Yu Zhengsheng, head of the CPPCC. Yesterday, the top leadership of the military endorsed the core status of Xi. "The troops must resolutely safeguard the core and follow the leadership of the CPC," Fan Changlong, vice chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC) headed by Xi, said while taking part in a panel deliberation of the government work report delivered by Premier Li Keqiang at the annual session of the NPC. CMC is the overall high command of the 2.3 million-strong Peoples Liberation Army (PLA). Under the Chinese political system, armed forces function under the CPC.

Robert Vadra, son-in-law of Congress president Sonia Gandhi, has slammed Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal for consistently targeting him. Vadra, in a Facebook post, asked Kejriwal to speak to him directly instead of making baseless charges."Robert Vadra seems to be the most referred name in the dictionary of Delhi CM. His remarks "Vadra will eat him alive" depict a strange obsession for me. I would humbly request our Delhi CM to come and speak with me directly, for all his grudges he has against me, instead of inciting other people against me. My best wishes to our Delhi CM, in all his endeavours," Vadra wrote. The businessman was referring to Kejriwal's statement in the Delhi Assembly a couple of days ago."You can only arrest Satyendar Jain, not (Sheila) Dikshit. If the PM raises a finger against Robert Vadra, I'll be convinced he has a 56-inch chest...Vadra will eat him alive...He (Modi) is taking revenge on the people of Delhi for choosing us, and has been blocking our work, but we have done so much despite the hindrance," Kejriwal had said while delivering his vote of thanks speech to the Lieutenant Governor's address in the Assembly. WHY KEJRIWAL HAS BEEN TARGETING VADRAIn 2012, Kejriwal had accused Vadra of being involved in a big land scam. He alleged that Vadra had purchased property worth crores of rupees on unsecured loans given by realty major DLF as quid pro quo for favours allegedly done to the company by Congress governments in Delhi, Rajasthan and Haryana.Kejriwal had alleged that property worth Rs 300 crore was given at throwaway prices by DLF to companies owned by Vadra with an unsecured interest free loan of Rs 65 crore from given by the realty firm.Both Vadra and DLF had then rubbished the charges.Watch the video here ALSO READ:
Berlin/ New Delhi, Mar 8 (PTI) Qatar Airways plans to set up an airline in India along with the Gulf nations sovereign wealth fund, its chief executive Akbar Al Baker said today. This will be the first of its kind airline venture in India that would be fully-owned by overseas entities and the proposal comes nearly nine months after the Indian government allowed 100 per cent foreign direct investment in the airlines segment. Qatar Airways, which is among the top three Gulf carriers, has been exploring investment opportunities in the fast- growing Indian aviation market. "We are joining hands with the investment arm of State of Qatar to start a domestic airline in India with a 100 per cent investment," Al Baker said at a press meet in Berlin. "We are doing this because Indian government has opened up the foreign direct investment in (setting up) an airline in India," he added. While announcing the plan, Al Baker said it is yet to apply to the Indian government. Last June, India allowed foreign investors -- barring overseas airlines -- to own up to 100 per cent stake in local carriers by liberalising FDI regulations. Currently, foreign airlines are allowed to invest only up to 49 per cent in Indian carriers. However, the revised norms provide room for overseas airlines to partner with a foreign non-airline player to set up a 100 per cent foreign-owned carrier in India. 
Ram Gopal Varma, filmmaker and enfant terrible on Twitter, once again did what he does best.The Sarkar 3 director took to Twitter to make a series of tweets regarding Women's Day which happens to be today, March 8.And so it began...Is there no #MensDay because all days in the year belong to only men and the women were given just only one day?Women's day should be called #MensDay because men celebrate women much more than women celebrate womenWomen on atleast #MensDay should not nag or scream and atleast give some freedom to menOn behalf of all men I hereby wish all the women a Very Happy #MensDayI don't know what men should be doing to women that day but I wish one day in year is celebrated as #MensWomensDayHowever, what obviously takes the crown for being the most Ramu-esque tweet possible is the one he wrote about Sunny Leone.I wish all the women in the world give men as much happiness as Sunny Leone gives"I wish all the women in the world give men as much happiness as Sunny Leone gives," RGV tweeted.What's amazing and really sporting of Sunny Leone is that she did not take offence to Ramu's tweet and replied, well, positively:Soon enough, Twitterati began attacking Ram Gopal Varma for being sexist, misogynist and so on. However, RGV was quick to respond saying that such attacks are only hypocritical.The negative noise towards my tweet on @SunnyLeone arises from ultimate hypocrisy.She has more honesty and more self respect than any womanI appreciate ur honesty in accepting @SunnyLeone gets more attention than all the other women combined ??? https://t.co/RTUxux1RbmAfter this, RGV spoke about making a short film that would expose the "sanctimoniousness of extremely antithetical multifarious perspectives on the phenomenon of Sunny Leone."Soon making short film on exposing sanctimoniousness of extremely antithetical multifarious perspectives on the phenomenon of @SunnyLeoneMy short film on her phenomenon will bare the veiled centrally decomposed cogitations in all the mentally corroded naysayers of @SunnyLeoneAll u illiterates who dint understand my earlier 2 tweets on @SunnyLeone atleast go through dictionary unless u are uneducated for that tooAway from the hungama on Twitter, Ram Gopal Varma will soon have to flex his directorial muscles on the big screen with Sarkar 3.

At least for an hour suspected terrorist Saifullah's brother and Uttar Pradesh Police tried to make him surrender even as he was hiding in a house in Haji Colony of Lucknow's Thakurganj area.The invocation of Prophet Mohammad did not deter him to drop the gun. He was finally gunned down following a 12-hour siege and anti-terror operation that ended today morning.His father Sartaj said the family will not take accept the body of an "anti-national". "He left home two months ago after I had beaten him up for not working. Last Monday he called me up and said he is going to Saudi Arabia," he said.Sartaj said that what his son did was "not in the country's interest". "We will not accept the body of an anti-national," he said. Top sources in the Uttar Pradesh Police told India Today that what Saifullah and his associates were planning was nothing less than "disastrous." A senior police officer said the plans if executed would have been "catastrophic".SAIFULLAH WAS ADAMANTAll possible efforts were made by police to dissuade Saifullah but sources said he was adamant despite his family's intervention.When Saifullah did not surrender despite persuasion by police, a meeting took place between top officers of the Uttar Pradesh Police to chalk out a strategy to discourage him from resisting security forces. Police by then had managed to identify Saifullah's relatives and decided to rope them in to talk him into surrendering.Senior police officers opened channels of communication and made his Kanpur-based brother Khalid speak to him for at least one hour. Saifullah, however, was not receptive; rather he was hostile and did not respond. He was "screaming that he wanted to die".FOCUS ON STUDIES, SAID FATHER His brother Khalid then tried to bring in their father Sartaj to talk to him. Sartaj was in tears and tried his best to convince him but in vain. He told Saifullah that he should devote himself to studies and not terror activities. At one point, his brother Khalid invoked Prophet Mohammad and asked Saifullah to give up in the name of Prophet. Saifullah, however, was not prepared to listen to anything. Officers said he was indoctrinated to a point where family members found it impossible to make him see the other side. "His family members were shattered when they discovered that someone who had spent his childhood and best years of his life with them was not willing to listen to them at all," said a senior police officer. ISIS INCREASING PRESENCE IN INDIAWhen the family members failed to dissuade him, police launched a full-scale operation to eliminate him, a senior police officer said.The Lucknow encounter shows that ISIS, which has so far asked Muslim youth to join them in the fight in Syria and Iraq, is now increasing its footprint in India with its Khorasan module .After receiving a tip-off from police in Telangana and Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh police swooped down on Saifulla's hideout.WHAT HAPPENED ON GROUND ZEROPolice drilled holes and used fiber-optic cameras to monitor his movement. They fired tear gas and chilly shells to force him out of the house.?ATS commandos issued a warning and stormed inside the house. Saifullah opened fire and in retaliation ATS commandos started firing. The rooms were searched, and Saifullah was found dead. The commandos saw a wire wrapped around his stomach, possibly to carry out a fidayeen attack. The UP police wanted to catch him alive as his interrogation could have shed light on the ISIS' Khorasan module, its plans and its sympathisers. Large cache of arms and ammunition, explosives, maps, ISIS flags were seized from the hideout. WATCH: Lucknow encounter: Know Saifullah, the killed ISIS suspectALSO READ:
From Lalit K Jha Washington, Mar 8 (PTI) Kansas Governor San Brownback has written a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressing "profound regret" at the terrible act of violence against the Indian nationals last month and said that acts of hate and intolerance have no place in his state. Srinivas Kuchibhotla, 32, was killed and Alok Madasani, another Indian of the same age, injured in a shooting by navy veteran Adam Purinton, who yelled "terrorist" and "get out of my country" before opening fire on them in Kansas last month. The Kansas incident and the two hate crime incidents against Indians and Indian-Americans since then has sent shock waves among the large Indian community in the US. "As Governor of the State of Kansas, I would like to express my deep sadness and profound regret at the terrible act of violence committed against Srinu Kuchibhotla and Alok Madasani. The people of Kansas share in my shock and horror. Words cannot express the sorrow that we feel for Srinus wife, Sunayana, and his family in Hyderabad," Brownback wrote. "In the time since Srinus death, we have reflected on his life, and the words I have heard most often to describe him are that he was courageous, and that he loved his family, and that he respected elders. We strive to live in Srinu?s example of courage and love and respect," he wrote in the letter dated March 3, a copy of which has been seen by PTI. Brownback wrote that Kansans have been awed by Sunayanas grace and determination. Her indomitable spirit has moved the entire community and they pray for her comfort and peace in this time of grief. Telling the Prime Minister that open arms of friendship are the very hallmarks of being a Kansan, the Governor said Srinu embodied the essence of what it means to be a Kansan. "His friends describe him as charming, caring and loving. He brought with him his immense talents and education and passion. His story is similar to the thousands of Indian diaspora who have called Kansas home over generations," he wrote. "They have enjoyed tremendous success through their ingenuity, hard work, and determination. Our state has thrived because of their contributions," Brownback wrote, adding that he would like to personally welcome Indians to his state. "Before they moved here, Sunayana said: Kansas was (the) instant choice. We are humbled that this was the case. I would like to personally welcome Indians to Kansas, and assure them that Kansas is a welcoming, hospitable place," he said.

Steve Smith is in the middle of a raging controversy after he looked at the dressing room for help with the Decision Review System.

While Sourav Ganguly, in an exclusive interview with Aaj Tak, asked for action to be taken against the Aussie captain, Michael Clarke told India Today it was unacceptable if Australia were indeed seeking help from outside the field for DRS. "From my perspective, when I was playing I remember having a brain fade when I gloved a ball and did not walk off. So I don't want to be too judgemental on anybody. If what Virat is saying is true and Australia are using their support staff to help them with DRS then that's not on, it is completely unacceptable," Clarke told India Today. "I think Smith respects the game and if it's a one-off, then it's a brain fade. "If you look at the footage, Peter Handscomb actually suggested Smith to turn around and look to the support staff. If this was a one-off, I don't think that would have happened. The fact that Handscomb is even thought of asking the Australian skipper to turn around and look to the support staff, I've got my concerns," Clarke said.

A study by TRAFFIC, an arm of World Wildlife Fund (WWF), recently found that at least three systems of traditional medicine in India - Siddha, Ayurveda and Unani - prescribe peacock feather and other parts in various potions.The practice is being followed by quacks and hospitals, including those funded by the ministry of AYUSH, in states like Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Delhi Gujarat and Rajasthan.The Indian blue peafowl (Pavo Cristatus) has considerably reduced in numbers over the years thanks to destruction of their habitats by farmers protecting their crops and poachers.

Jammu and Kashmir lost against Jharkhand on the field, but off it the cricketers from the northern valley emerged gainers when former India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni decided to spend some time with them answering their cricketing queries.A couple of years back, the J&K cricketers had a similar chance when Sachin Tendulkar dropped in at the Wankhede Stadium dressing room after they upset Mumbai in a Ranji Trophy gameIt was a nightmare of a tournament for J&K as they lost all but one match finishing last in their group. After being beaten by Jharkhand in a Vijay Hazare Trophy match, it was J&K skipper and India international Parvez Rasool who requested Dhoni to have a chat with the boys.On Rasool's request, the World Cup-winning skipper headed straight to the J&K dressing room and patiently listened to their queries spending about 15 minutes."Mahi bhai has always been helpful on cricketing matters. That's his nature. It was a great opportunity to learn a thing or two from Mahi bhai. He is a great guy. I played alongside him for India," Rasool said."I told him (Dhoni) few of our youngsters want to meet him for five minutes and within no time he obliged us and said 'I will go from here'," Rasool said.'GREAT OPPORTUNITY'Some of them saw Dhoni for the first time, while their reserve wicketkeeper Raman Thaploo was a great fan of the former Indian camp as it was a lifetime opportunity for them."It was a great opportunity for our youngsters who have seen Dhoni only on TV.. They saw Mahi bhai for the first time today. Mahi went inside and answered their cricketing queries."Raman also got some wicketkeeping tips from his idol and there were some tips for their struggling batsmen and also their middle-order batsman Ian Dev Singh, who is going through a patchy form with scores of 24, 0, 1, 13 and 2 in his last five innings."He explained Raman how to react in subcontinent conditions. Our batsmen going through bad patches. He said, 'Every cricketer goes through a bad phase. When you are in good form, even a bad fielder takes a brilliant catch but it's opposite in bad times. He said to work even harder in such testing times, be serious in the nets. You should not get out in nets. You will take confidence if you have this'."Having partnered Dhoni in a brief 27-run partnership in a T20I against England in Kanpur last month, Rasool was awestruck to see his game-reading capability from the other end.
After 11 hours, the Lucknow siege has finally come to an end with the suspected terrorist Saiful killed in the encounter. The target of the operation was a house in Haji Ali Colony in Thakurganj, on the outskirts of Lucknow. Early on, the operation seemed limited in its scope, with the police using chilli bombs and stun grenades to flush out the militants.The standoff began early Tuesday evening, hours after at least ten people were injured in a blast on the Ujjain Express. Suspected ISIS terrorist Saiful from the Lucknow siege is believed to be linked to the blast.The operation and the blast both came a day before today's seventh phase of polling in Uttar Pradesh, but there have been no indications that the developments are linked to the five-state Assembly elections, the results for which will be announced March 11. ISIS MODULE AT WORK?Saiful lived at the Thakurganj home with two other youngsters. The trio moved into the home, which belongs to a Saudi Arabia-based person called Badshah, around three months ago.They were known to keep to themselves and seldom stepped out of the house except for early morning jogs and to buy essentials.Saiful is believed to be part of a larger ISIS-inspired module that is suspected to be behind the Tuesday morning train blast.The module is believed to include Saiful, the two men arrested in Kanpur, the one nabbed in Eatawah and the three detained in Madhya Pradesh.Atif Muzaafffar, one of the three men arrested in Madhya Pradesh, is believed to be the leader of the module.

Saif Ali Khan, Shahid Kapoor and Kangana Ranaut and their latest film Rangoon is in new trouble. The film has rubbed the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) the wrong way, as a result of which, it might land in a legal mess.Rangoon, directed by Vishal Bhardwaj, is playing in theatres without a censor certificate and the anti-tobacco short films. As a result, the CBFC is mighty miffed with the makers of Rangoon. While on the one hand, Rangoon any which way, hasn't been getting any love at the ticket windows, this will end up adding to the plethora of problems the film is battling.Pahlaj Nihalani, the chairperson of the CBFC, told DNA, "It has been brought to our notice that Rangoon has been playing in theatres across the country and outside India without the censor certificate and without the anti-smoking short films, which are compulsory for all films that show actors smoking and/or drinking. Rangoon had many scenes showing the main leads indulging in serious substance abuse. We asked the makers to put a disclaimer ahead of the opening credits. That disclaimer has gone missing. Now, we have been informed that the anti-smoking films do not play at the beginning and after the intermission. And also that the censor certificate is not flashed at the start, as per law. These are serious offences."The film, which is a love story set against the backdrop of the World War II, stars Saif Ali Khan as film producer Rusi Bilimoria, Kangana Ranaut as the fiesty Miss Julia (a character based on Fearless Nadia), and Shahid Kapoor as Jamadar Nawab Malik of the British Indian Army.Rangoon, said Nihalani, has flouted several rules set by the CBFC. And if found true, the CBFC chairman told the tabloid, action will be taken against the team."We are taking legal action against the digital operators, to begin with. We would not like to point fingers at anyone else for the lapse at this time. It is the digital operators' responsibility to play exactly the length that is shown to us and certified by the CBFC. Not a second more or less of footage must be shown in theatres than what we have certified. The exact length of the film that is shown to us and certified by us is mentioned in the censor certificate. If the anti-smoking films have been removed from the beginning and after intermission and if the censor certificate is not being shown in Rangoon, then, the digital operators are screening less footage than what has been approved by the CBFC. It is a serious offence. We are investigating to see how deep the offence goes," said Nihalani.The CBFC head went on to add, "Maybe some self-appointed intellectuals of our film industry feel it is okay to break the law as long as they can ridicule the jurisdiction of the CBFC." Rangoon's laidback pace and lack of a coherent storyline has been pointed out as reasons behind its worrisome performance at the box office in India. In more than a week of release, Rangoon hasn't even made it to the Rs 50-crore mark in the country.OPINION: Rangoon is a box-office disaster despite good reviews. Why?

The International Cricket Council is planning to send a World XI to Pakistan in late September for a four-match Twenty20 series in Lahore that will look to build on the successful staging of the Pakistan Super League final in the city on Sunday.The four-match series at the Gaddafi Stadium ? to be called The Independence Cup to mark the 70th anniversary of partition ? is intended to continue the reintroduction of top-level cricket to the country after a near eight-year hiatus. The break resulted from the attack on the Sri Lanka team bus in 2009 and has meant Pakistan, bar one series against Zimbabwe two years ago, have played home internationals at neutral venues.Details of which players will feature in the World XI are yet to be established. Six overseas cricketers ? including Kevin Pietersen, Luke Wright and Tymal Mills ? withdrew from Sunday?s PSL final following the tournament?s switch from the United Arab Emirates and in light of two bomb blasts in the preceding weeks.England?s Chris Jordan and the Middlesex batsman Dawid Malan, along with the former West Indies captain Darren Sammy, were among the eight who travelled as, amid a military-style security operation that saw the city in lockdown and bulletproof team buses escorted by elite troops, the match passed without incident. Peshawar Zalmi beat Quetta Gladiators by 58 runs.Giles Clarke, the president of the England and Wales Cricket Board, heads the ICC?s Pakistan Task Force that has been looking at ways to end a drought of international cricket and stated the PSL final, while not simply a test run for the World XI series in itself, has shown cricket can be staged in Lahore.?The desire is to give the cricket-starved Pakistani supporters the chance to see some of the world?s finest players in live action,? Clarke said. ?The world of cricket needs to help Pakistan, who cannot continue to play their home fixtures overseas. The youth need inspiring, and the national teams need far more cricket played in familiar terrain. Furthermore, the terrorists cannot win and cricket must not give up on Pakistan.?The World XI series overseas team will assemble in Dubai on 17 September, before flying to Lahore for four matches on the 22nd, 23rd, 28th and 29th, and follow a similar security plan to the PSL final, the rehearsals for which were overseen by an ICC delegation who included the ECB?s security director, Reg Dickason.Malan, speaking before playing Sunday?s final, said he made himself available after being talked through the security plans and following guarantees over player and spectator safety. ?As soon as they brought out how tough it would be to get to the players, I almost felt it was my duty to come and represent the team and do the right thing by them,? he said. ?Despite all the concerns that there have been in Pakistan, there has been an initiative to try to bring top-class cricket back to the country.?
programmes Mumbai, Mar 6 (PTI) The Maharashtra Government spent Rs 8 crore from Contingency Fund to meet publicity expenses for the foundation stone laying ceremonies of various projects which were kicked off by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last December. The projects also included the "jal poojan" of the Chhatrapati Shivaji memorial in Arabin sea.

New Delhi, Mar 6 (PTI) Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal today said Delhi will be made as clean as London keeping its unique cultural ethos intact, seeking to clarify his earlier remarks which have been mocked by the Opposition. Kejriwal said that his Aam Aadmi Party would clean up the capital within one year of coming to power in the three municipal corporations of Delhi (MCDs). "I want to clarify that I have not said that we will turn Delhi into London. Delhi has its own culture and its heart... Delhis people are very good. "When we go to western countries including London, we see a high level of cleanliness there. Delhi will be made as clean as London, which only the AAP can do," he told reporters. While addressing a gathering yesterday, Kejriwal had said that if the AAP won the MCD polls, it would spruce up Delhi and make it look like London within a year. The Delhi chief minister also slammed the BJP and the Congress, saying that both the parties which have been controlling the MCDs for 20 years have failed to clean up the city. "The BJP and the Congress have been ruling municipal corporations for 20 years and they have destroyed MCDs (financially). It is the first responsibility of MCDs to clean up Delhi. "It is only the AAP which can clean up Delhi as people know that we have done unprecedented works in education, water, power and health," the Delhi chief minister said. Over his Londons remark, Delhi BJP President Manoj Tiwari hit out at Kejriwal, saying "he should first make Delhi a better Delhi before planning to make it London." 
Talk about small steps and giant leaps. On March 7, 1987, a quick single nudged through the slips to a Pakistani bowler named Ejaz Fakih took Sunil Manohar Gavaskar from his innings score of 57 to 58 at the Sardar Patel Stadium in rural Motera outside Ahmedabad. That run also took Gavaskar to a territory which, never mind the batsman, even cricket itself had never seen. Fifty seven to fifty eight sent Gavaskar from 9,999 to the first 10,000th run in Test cricket. Non-striker Kiran More says Gavaskar celebrated that moment like he usually didn't do in cricket. He sprinted. Or at least that's what it seemed like to millions watching TV because it was an accomplishment that all of India wanted to own quickly. So we believe that in that instant, this deliberate, determined Indian batsman was quicker than usual. His head slightly lowered, mid-single, Gavaskar raised his bat in both triumph and celebration. AlsoBy evening, he was out for 63 and they say when he returned to the dressing room, at first he was not satisfied, but furious. Gavaskar's principle never changed: every run counted, every innings had to be maximised. So 10,000 had been achieved but to not extend that innings of 63 irked him. If he ever got out after getting in, dressing rooms would usually clear out to give the infuriated maestro his space. When play ended, what he did have though, was contentment, "I would have just been happy with 1,000 runs. Now I feel 10 times more fantastic." No wonder, even in the dry state of Gujarat that night, they sourced some champagne to go with the cake. India did not know it then but Gavaskar was to play only one more Test after Ahmedabad. When he retired later that year, the country was in deep gloom: Indian cricket's defender, its most gritty general had gone. He had re-defined the standards of excellence and professionalism, re-written definitions in the school of Indian batsmanship. It is said he has no mementos from the match in which he crossed 10,000, but he wouldn't need any: Sunil Gavaskar's achievement always carries with it the power of everlasting memory. --by Sharda Ugra

Los Angeles, Mar 5 (PTI) Actor Warren Beatty has been praised for how he handled the Oscars Best Picture drama by the shows producer Michael De Luca. The 79-year-old actor and his "Bonnie & Clyde" co-star Faye Dunaway, 76, were given the wrong envelope at the Academy Awards last month, leading Faye to mistakenly announce "La La Land" as the winner, instead of "Moonlight". And the Oscars producer believes Warren is the "unsung hero" of the night, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Referring to when Warren hesitated and showed Faye the card with the winners name, Michael says, "I actually think Warren Beatty is the unsung hero here, completely heroic. I think he was showing her (Dunaway) the card, like, hey are you seeing what Im seeing? I think a mistakes been made here. To me, they are heroes and completely in the clear." And Michael believes PricewaterhouseCoopers accountant Brian Cullinan, who handed Warren the wrong envelope, and his colleague Martha Ruiz, could have done more to smooth things over. "If I was in that job, and I know Im Monday morning quarterbacking, which I detest, but I feel like if its my one job, if I heard the wrong name, Id walk directly to Warren Beatty and say you got the wrong envelope, heres the right envelope, and make a charming moment out of it." 
INS Viraat, Indian Navy's flagship aircraft carrier, will retire from service today. The aircraft carrier which holds the Guinness Record for the oldest carrier in service was inducted into the Indian Navy on May 12, 1987. The ship, famously known as the 'Grand Old Lady', was with the British Royal Navy since 1959 before the Indian government bought it for Rs 6.5 crore in 1987.

New Delhi, Mar 5 (PTI) Capital markets watchdog SEBI may be among Indias most powerful regulators today but there was a time when people used to introduce its former chief U K Sinha as Chairman of SBI -- a similar sounding acronym but of State Bank of India. ??"At the start of my tenure at SEBI, people would introduce me as the chairperson of SBI, the State Bank of India (the country?s largest bank with a far flung branch network). Today, you go to a small village in India and they know SEBI," says Sinha, who retired as SEBI Chairman last week after a six-year tenure -- the second largest in nearly three decades of existence of the regulatory body.    ?Sinhas remarks are part of a detailed case study on the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) done by Professor Suraj Srinivasan of the Harvard Business School. ?The study titled Securities Exchange Board of India: Developing and Regulating India?s Capital Markets has been done by Suraj along with research associate Radhika Kak.  According to the study, Sinha was reflecting on his past five years as the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) when he made these remarks. ??"It was February 2016 and he had just been appointed by the Government of India to a second term as the Chairman of SEBI," it noted. While SEBI as a regulator has made significant strides over the past decade, it was during Sinhas tenure that its powers increased manifold including for bringing to book entities guilty of insider trading and fraudulent investment activities such as illicit collective investment schemes. SEBIs tough actions against several large corporates even prompted some in recent years to call the regulator a dragon and of acting like an activist. 
India on Sunday hoisted the tallest tricolour in the country at the Attari border. The 360-foot tall flag is high enough to be spotted from Lahore in Pakistan. Hoisted on a 110-meter high mast, the flag is 120-foot long and 80-foot wide. The weight of the flag pole is 55 tonnes, and an estimated Rs 3.50 crore rupees have been spent on this project by the Punjab government.Before this, the title of the tallest national flag in India belonged to a 293-foot-high tricolour that was hoisted in Jharkhand's Ranchi. PAKISTAN OBJECTSInterestingly, Pakistan is not happy with India's decision to hoist the tricolour at the international border. Sources said the Pakistan Rangers had also conveyed their resentment to the Border Security Force (BSF) and had asked them to install the flag away from the border.Pakistan on Thursday had again raised an objection to the flag being flown at the IB, calling the act a violation of international treaties. Pakistan authorities apparently fear that India could use the mast to spy in Pakistani land by installing cameras on the flag pole.INDIA: NOT VIOLATING ANY TREATYHowever, Indian authorities had made it clear that the flat was being installed 200 metres before the zero line and was not a violation in any manner."Not to my knowledge. It is our national flag and nobody can stop us from hoisting it on our soil," said Anil Joshi, a minister in the Punjab government, who hoisted the flag on Sunday.

The Padmini palace, located inside the historical Chittorgarh Fort, was at the receiving end of an act of vandalism by some men who broke the mirror work there. The Fort, situated in Rajasthan's Chittorgarh district and the folklore surrounding it, had been at the centre of attention after the attack on film director Sanjay Leela Bhansali and his unit during the making of the movie Padmavati in Jaipur and the subsequent brouhaha.A few days back, Karni Sena had issued a warning seeking the removal of the mirrors there. The fringe outfit claimed Padmavati had committed Jauhar (an act of killing self) to protect the Rajput honour and vehemently refuted that Allaudin Khilji had seen Padmavati's face through a mirror or there was any romantic liaison between the two . The outfit claimed mirrors were not in existence during Padmavati's era and had come into being much later.A police complaint has been registered against unknown persons by Archaeological department officials.The Karni Sena had indulged in violent protest against the crew of the movie Padmavati and its shooting. They claimed historical facts were distorted and characters of Padmavati and Khilji were portrayed in a manner which hurt Rajput pride. The outfit claimed it had information the script of the movie contained dream romantic sequence between Allaudin Khilji and Padmavati, an assertion refuted by Sanjay Leela Bhansali Production unit.

Los Angeles, Mar 5 (PTI) "House of Cards" creator Beau Willimon wants Twitter to delete Donald Trumps account and even shared a 16-point argument as to why the President "should be removed" from the micro-blogging website. Trump, in a series of tweets, accused his predecessor Barack Obama of "wire tapping" his office in New York just before the 2016 presidential elections and likened the alleged surveillance of his communications to the "Watergate" scandal. Referring to Trumps posts, Willimon, 39, wrote, "Todays tantrum is just the latest example of why @realDonaldTrump and @POTUS must be removed from @Twitter." Adding that being the President of the United States comes with "a supreme and unique responsibility unlike any other user" Willimon wrote that Trumps tweets have a "real and significant impact on the business of governance, world affairs and national security." "President Trump has consistently made misleading claims, attacked the judiciary and threatened sovereign states, the press and public," he continued. He further said how todays outburst "is broadcasting to foreign leaders his continuing impulsiveness, recklessness, delusion and ignorance about government." Adding, "That makes Trumps tweets a national security threat. It emboldens our enemies to take advantage of his flagrant shortcomings." He also pointed out that if people argue that removing his account is "violation of free speech" then consider how "the White House has retaliated against the press by selectively locking them out, called them the enemy of the people and ignored hard questions." 
In a shameful incident right under the nose of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, few strongmen from the Dalit community passed a diktat of tonsuring the head of a Dalit woman and her brother -in-law suspecting an illicit relation between the two. The Talibani diktat was passed and later executed on 22nd February in the Machriyawan village in Fatuha, about 30 kms from Patna. The two were later paraded in front of the entire village after their heads were tonsured.The Dalit woman Soni Devi with her baby and her brother-in-law Shailendra Ram were abused and their faces blackened while they were paraded in the village. After facing massive humiliation from people of her own community, Soni Devi left the village after the incident.Surprisingly, the local police remained unaware about the entire incident for 11 days. When, the matter came to light a couple of days ago, the police hunted for the Dalit woman and her brother-in-law and on their complaint filed an FIR against the 5 accused persons, of which three are women. Police have arrested two persons Jageshwar and Rajdev in connection with this case. The three women accused however are still at large and the police are looking out for them."The incident took place on 22nd February. Villagers allege that the woman and her brother-in-law were having illicit relations and were caught red handed. The victims are from the Mahadalit community and therefore they could not muster the courgae to file a complaint against the accused the day the incident happened. Now a case has been registered and we are investigating the matter", said Sujeet Kumar, SHO, Fatuha police station.
Pitching for Aam Aadmi Party?s victory in the upcoming municipal elections, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said if his party comes to power in MCD then they will make Delhi comparable to London.Addressing a gathering at Uttam Nagar, Kejriwal said the BJP-ruled municipal bodies have not been able to keep Delhi clean.The dates for MCD elections are yet to be announced.?Last time you gave us 67 seats but this time don?t even leave the 3 seats. If we win MCD once, we will change Delhi so much in one year that you will compare Delhi to London,? he said.The CM said that people have the misconception that Delhi is not clean due to AAP government?s failure. ?Wherever I go, people have misconception that garbage is not being picked up and there is no cleaning because of Delhi government. It is not our but MCD?s responsibility,? he said.Kejriwal said the BJP and Congress have been leading the municipal bodies for the last 20 years without doing anything.?They have looted MCD. MCD collects so much money from house tax, hoarding, parking. Last year, Delhi government gave them Rs 2,800 crore. But where is all this money? Why is Delhi not being cleaned? They make the same road thrice on paper and eat all the money,? he said.Kejriwal said his government has been able to do many things in the last two years which the BJP-run governments in Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh have not been able to do in the last 10-15 years.?Before we came to power, the Delhi government had a policy of doing development activity in regularised colonies only. But we changed it. We said it doesn?t matter if the colony is regularised or not, people living there are humans and they need water, sewer, power, and road,? he said.Meanwhile, Congress workers led by former Uttam Nagar legislator Mukesh Sharma protested near the venue where Kejriwal was addressing the gathering. As they tried to show black flags, police stopped the protesters from reaching near the crowd. The protesters then burnt effigy of Kejriwal accusing the AAP government of ?cheating the city residents?. ?All these inaugurations are an eyewash.

London, Mar 5 (PTI) Muslim women swimmers have won the right to race in loose-fitting full body outfits or burkinis while taking part in amateur swimming competitions in England. On a request from the Muslim Womens Sport Foundation, the Amateur Swimming Association (ASA) has relaxed its swimsuit regulations to allow women to wear loose-fitting full body outfits. Until now, full body suits like those worn by Olympians have been banned, as they help streamline the shape of the body and have performance-enhancing characteristics. The new guidance, which will only apply to amateur competitions in England, states that competitors will not be allowed to wear any suit that a competition referee believes will increase performance, The Telegraph reported. Photographs published by the governing body suggested that loose-fitting outfits would be permissible, while specifically excluding body suits similar to those worn by elite competitors. "Swimmers wishing to swim in such a suit shall present the suit to the event referee for inspection prior to their swim," the guidance states. "Once the referee has been informed of a swimmer wishing to wear a suit, as described above, there is no requirement for the referee to question the swimmer further, the ASA swimming management group do not want athletes being asked why they wish to wear the suit," it says. Chris Bostock, chairman of the ASA sport governing board, termed the move as a "very positive step forward" for competitive swimming in England and one that he hoped would encourage many more people to take part. 
From Aditi Khanna London, Mar 5 (PTI) Tata Steel may be considering breaking off talks over a planned merger of its European business with German conglomerate Thyssenkrupp, a UK media report claimed today. The merger talks had been revealed by the Indian steel giant last year as part of a major restructuring of its UK steel business. Such a deal with the German steel major could potentially lead to the formation of a European steel behemoth with blast furnaces in Wales, the Netherlands and Germany. However, The Sunday Times claims that the deal may be under threat due to German pension liabilities. The deal has been slow moving as Tata Steel tries to solve the problem of its own 15-billion-pound British steel pensions scheme. Last month its UK workers had voted in favour of a new pension deal to save their jobs. Nearly 10,000 workers voted in a ballot in favour of moving from a final salary pension to a less generous scheme in return for job safety and Tatas promise of nearly 1-billion-pound worth of investment over the next 10 years. According to the newspaper, Dutch unions representing workers at Tatas vast Ijmuiden plant have raised concerns over the Thyssenkrupp pensions, which are an unfunded liability and underpinned by cash-flow from the steelworks. Thyssenkrupp is under pressure from the activist investor Cevian and recently sold its steel venture in Brazil for 1.3 billion euros. 
A Rajasthan BJP MLA's blatant abuse of power was on full display as he brazenly refused to pay toll on the Jaipur-Nagaur Highway. In a video available with India Today, the BJP MLA from Makrana, Shreeram Bhincher, can be seen arguing with the toll plaza employee. At one point, after the toll plaza employee comes in front of the vehicle, the MLA can be seen pushing him away. He says he is ready to fight.When contacted by India Today, Bhincher remained defiant. Without an iota of regret, the MLA refuted he threatened the toll plaza employees. He claimed they stopped his car and stood in front of it. The MLA also claimed that some toll plaza employees do not know the difference between an MLA pass, a driving licence and an ATM Card. In the 1 minute 51 seconds long video, the MLA can be seen repeatedly arguing with the toll plaza employee. At one point in the video, he says it's their marriage entourage. Their uncle's (mama) marriage entourage. He says all vehicles go like this only (without paying toll). The BJP MLA allegedly ensured at least 50 vehicles left the toll booth without paying any toll.
A BJP MP has moved a private member's bill in the Lok Sabha, seeking reservation of five seats in the Lower House as well as one in the Rajya Sabha for residents of Gilgit and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) regions. "It is a matter of extreme surprise that the Lower House does not take into account this territory, whereas the State Legislature of Jammu and Kashmir keeps 25 seats vacant for the territory which is under illegal occupation of Pakistan," said Nishikant Dubey, who has piloted the bill. "It would be proper that seats provided for the Jammu and Kashmir area, which is under illegal occupation of Pakistan, in the Lok Sabha are kept vacant as elections can not be held in these areas," he said. Dubey expects the bill to be taken up during the second phase of the Budget Session of Parliament starting from March 9. INSERTION OF NEW ARTICLE 370AThe Legislation asks for an insertion of new Article 370A, after Article 370, in the Constitution of India, to add five Lok Sabha seats and one Rajya Sabha seat. However, these seats would be kept vacant as elections can not be held in these areas. At the same time, these seats shall not be taken into account for reckoning the total membership of both houses and the said area shall be excluded in delimiting the territorial constituencies, the bill proposes. Dubey had tried twice to introduce this private member's bill, once in November 2014 and in February 2015 again, but on both occasions Deputy Speaker of the Lok Sabha disallowed it. "I will approach all the members and try to build a consensus on this landmark legislation," Dubey said, adding that the purpose behind moving this legislation is to highlight the atrocities committed by Pakistan in these areas. Time has come to correct the mistake that is being carried out from 1950s, he added.

The Income Tax department dealt a body blow to the reputation of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) by attaching assets allegedly amassed illegally by Satyendar Jain, a senior minister in the Delhi government.The assets attached under the Benami Act include more than 100 bighas of land with investment value of Rs 17 crore and shares amounting to Rs 16 crore.Jain, who holds the portfolios of industry, power, health and public works department in Delhi?s AAP government, denied the allegations.??my name has been wrongly dragged to create a false impression against me,? Jain said in a statement.But if the allegations are substantiated, it will be a major setback to AAP and the government headed by Arvind Kejriwal. The central claim, which powered the party so dramatically to power in Delhi two years ago, was built on anti-corruption. Coming just ahead of the municipal elections in Delhi, the revelations could potentially impact AAP?s prospects in the electoral contest.The AAP also denied all charges.?There has been no order that has been received by Satyendar Jain on this issue. He was an architect by profession before he joined politics. He was a member of the board of the companies but he quit six months before he was given a ticket by the AAP in 2013,? said a senior party leader, who did not wish to be named.The provisional attachment orders, dated February 27, were issued under the Benami Prohibition transactions act 1988 by the initiating officer of the National capital territory of Delhi to Indo Metalimpex Pvt Ltd, Akinchan Developers Pvt Ltd, Paryas Infosolutions and Mangalaytan Projects Pvt Ltd under the act.The order said that cash consideration for making illegal entries in Indo Metalimpex Pvt Ltd and Akinchan Developers Pvt Ltd was provided by Jain. The money received from the accommodation entries in the form of share capital/premium was used to purchase the properties, the order added. Jain said in his statement that he had not been associated since July 31, 2013 with any of the companies. ?I have earned all my income with my hard work and I have been a tax payer for decades. I am not afraid of any probe about my income details, nor am I scared of any political vendetta, but I reserve the right for appropriate legal action in case my name is unnecessarily dragged into a controversy.?The AAP has, in the past, claimed a witch-hunt by a ?hostile? union government led by the Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP), a political rival. Since 2015, more than ten MLAs of the Delhi assembly have been arrested in various cases.This is not the first time Jain has come under the scanner. According to the Press Trust of India, in September, the income tax department issued summons Jain and asked him to appear in connection with a tax evasion probe against certain Kolkata-based firms.

New Delhi, Mar 5 (PTI) E-commerce major Flipkart is looking to hire 20-30 per cent more people in 2017 compared to last year even as rival Snapdeal hands out pink slips to its employees. The Bengaluru-based firm, which is locked in an intense battle with the US-based Amazon for leadership in the Indian market, will hire most laterals this year. "Our 2017 hiring plans are calibrated to the growth momentum we are seeing and we expect it to be somewhere around 20% to 30% higher than last year, spread out as per requirements across verticals," Flipkart COO Nitin Seth told PTI. He added that a majority of this will likely come in through the lateral route. "We believe this offers us the right mix of talent needed to power the next phase of growth at Flipkart," he said. Seth, however, declined to comment on the hiring number this year or in the previous year. According to sources, Flipkart hired about 1,500 people last year. Besides, it hired about 10,000 temporary staffers, mostly in logistics, ahead of festive sales to ensure it can meet the huge jump in demand. According to research firm RedSeer, the Indian e-tailing industry expanded by a merely 12 per cent in 2016 to clock revenues of USD 14.5 billion compared to a whopping 180 per cent growth in 2015. With raising of fresh funds becoming difficult and markdown in valuations, many of these technology-led businesses are being forced to pare down workforce or shut businesses.

Amid controversies over drivers' earnings and incentives offered to them, Uber on Friday said that currently 80 per cent of its drivers across India who are online for more than six hours a day, make between Rs 1,500 to Rs 2,500 net, after its service fee."Small numbers of individuals, who do not represent the majority of the driver community, have been preventing drivers who want to work from doing so. We have been communicating daily to drivers - through phone support, text and video messages and in person at our greenlight centres, where every day thousands of drivers walk in to resolve their concerns," Uber India President Amit Jain said in a blog post on Friday.He also said its business grew over three years in India and the company is seeing sustainable earning opportunities for driver partners and sustained interest in driving with a 60 percent year-on-year increase in driver signups in January 2017.FYI || Mumbai model arrested for joking about a bomb at Sahar airport ||INCENTIVES AND PROMOTIONSAbout the incentives, Jain said that drivers earn money from fares paid by riders, but also from incentives, for instance, a driver may earn a certain amount of money once they have hit a certain number of trips."Uber rolls out incentives and promotions to introduce the service in new cities. Without doing this, it's hard to ensure drivers are compensated for their time when few riders are aware of the service," he said, adding that as more riders use it, drivers would be busier and could earn more."This in turn attracts more drivers, which helps guarantee faster pickups for riders, and allows us to adjust incentives over time," he said.FYI || From video invites to drones, Maharashtra BJP chief's son's wedding is straight out of a Karan Johar movie ||UBER APPJain further said: "We can't serve riders or cities the way we want to without drivers, so we need to ensure at all times that the app is the most rewarding option for them to choose. But we also need to consider affordable prices for riders that allow the service to grow and drivers to know when they switch on the app, there will always be people looking for a ride."Striking a balance isn't always easy, but without attractive earnings for drivers the service simply wouldn't work, he noted.
Eight fishermen from Tamil Nadu's Pudukkottai district were arrested by Sri Lankan officials yesterday.Seven of these fishermen are being held in Triconmalee in Sri Lanka, and will be presented in court at the earliest.The other fisherman attempted suicide soon after being taken into custody, and has been admitted to the Triconmalee hospital.In just the past week, 26 fishermen and four trawler boats from India have been taken into custody.

Talking about the delayed action by the Sri Lankan and Indian governments, Alexander said, "After the two countries talk...we thought that there will be an end to our problems, but sadly the situation still continues and our fishermen still face arrests and threat of being killed in the sea all the time."Fishermen from the coastal districts of Ramanathapuram, Nagapattinam, Pudukkottai, Tuticorin and Karaikkal have decided to go on a strike. They're also planning to conduct a road roko on February 6.
A 43-year-old Indian-origin store owner in the US has been shot dead outside his home, just days after an Indian engineer was killed in Kansas in a hate crime shooting that had sent shockwaves across the country. Harnish Patel, 43, the owner of a convenience store in Lancaster County, South Carolina, was found dead of gunshot wounds in the front yard of his home on Thursday, coroner and police officials said.

He had locked up his nearby store less than 10 minutes before he was found dead, police said.Also read: Kansas shooting: Silence observed at US Congress; White House says case looks racially motivatedPatel was found in the yard a few minutes before midnight, according to a statement from the Lancaster County Coroners Office. Lancaster County police received calls at 11:33 PM after people called 911 to say that they heard screaming and gunshots. Sheriff Barry Faile said the Indian ethnicity of Patel does not appear to be a factor in the crime. "I dont have any reason to believe that this was racially motivated," Faile said Friends and customers were in shock and were visiting Patels home to offer condolences to his family. "Who would do anything like this to him, as good as he is to everybody," Nicole Jones, a frequent customer at Patels store, told WBTV. Also read: Trump on shooting of Indian man: America is united in condemning hate and evilJones and other friends said Patel was not always worried about the bottom line of his business. "If you didnt have the money, he'd let people have food," Jones said. Mario Sadler, another customer and friend, said Patel had offered him jobs before, and did anything he could to help out in tough times. "Hes watched my kids grow up, which is why its painful. From day one hes been amazing, just awesome, and I just dont understand the sense behind it," Sadler said. Dilipkumar Gajjar, a close friend of Patel and the owner the ABC store next to the Speedee Mart, said Patel came over to this country to better his family's life, and did that. Patels death comes close on the heels of the shooting in Kansas of a 32-year-old Indian engineer Srinivas Kuchibhotla, who was killed when 51-year-old US Navy veteran Adam Purinton opened fire at him and his friend Alok Madasani at a bar before yelling "get out of my country." The shooting last month had sent shockwaves across the Indian-American community with people expressing concerns over their safety in an environment of xenophobic and racist rhetoric in the country. 
New Delhi, Mar 3 (PTI) Taking on Rahul Gandhi for his criticism of Prime Minister Narendra Modi over cleaning of the Ganga, Union Minister Uma Bharti today asked the Congress leader to refrain from making "frivolous" comments. Bharti, Union Minister for Water Resources, claimed the work on cleaning the river was on and lay a wager that the Congress vice president "jumps into the river" if positive results of the first phase of the project were not evident by 2018 "otherwise I will jump". The feisty sadhvi also targeted Gandhi for attacking Modi over his "son of the Ganga from Gujarat" comment, saying the Congress leader should know that his mother Sonia Gandhi "reveres the river" despite her Italian origin. "He (Rahul) says Prime Minister is from Gujarat and calls Ganga his maa (mother)...kafi chhote dimag ke aadmi hain Rahul (he is narrow minded). He is not aware that the entire world considers Ganga its mother," she said. Rahul had yesterday accused Modi of making "conditional promises and deals" even with "Ganga maa". Alleging that Modi did not only make promises to Ganga, but even struck deals with her, Gandhi said, "Modi told Maa Ganga that first make him the Prime Minister and then he will carry out the cleaning work." "Modi strikes a relationship with mother Ganga saying he is the son of Banaras and that mother Ganga called him there (to contest Lok Sabha polls)," Gandhi told a poll rally in Varanasi yesterday. Asking whether the Ganga had only one son and "that too from Gujarat", Gandhi had said the holy river belonged to everyone and not any single person. Bharti, who heads the Modi governments ambitious Namami Gange programme as Union Minister for Water Resources, said phase I of the Clean Ganga Mission, launched in July 2016, was intended to be complete by October next year. "Rahul says Ganga has not been cleaned yet. We will show results of phase I works in October 2018. Rahul should accompany me to Banaras then and I will show him that the work has been completed," Bharti told PTI over phone from Varanasi. "If the work is complete, he should jump into the Ganga. If its not, I will. He should not make frivolous comments about Ganga." Bharti said Gandhi had aligned with "Gangas enemy", the UP Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav who, she alleged, tried to hamper the project. She alleged that Yadav did not give the No Objection Certificate for starting the Phase I of the project in UP. She said the first phase covered five river basin states of Uttarakhand, Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal, besides UP. 
The Delhi government has sanctioned Rs 54.84 crore for the construction of a skywalk at ITO. With the two Metro stations and a railway line and major traffic crossings within one km, the Public Works Department (PWD) wants to have the longest skywalk of the capital at ITO. It will connect offices and entry/exit points of Metro stations. Read: Delhi roads not safe for pedestrians, finds study?There are over 25 offices at ITO, besides two Metro stations, the Tilak Bridge railway station and seven major arterial roads. The heavy traffic volume and crowd makes it an accident-prone area for pedestrians,? said PWD official, explaining the need for the skywalk.  ?Because of the new Metro station at ITO, the crowd at the junction has gone up,? said a PWD official.Currently, there is only one foot overbridge on the Vikas Marg in front of the ITO building. Recently, the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) constructed a subway, allowing pedestrians to cross Vikas Marg, BSZ Marg and the DDU Marg. However, there is no foot overbridge or subway at the Pragati Maidan Metro station crossing putting lives at risk. PWD said one foot overbridge (FOB) should connect the footpath of Sikandra Road (towards Tilak Marg) to the parking lot near Pragati Maidan Metro station across Mathura Road.

The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) has called for a state-wide dharna and protest to demand the ouster of Bihar minister Abdul Jalil Mastan, who called Prime Minister Narendra Modi a "Naxal" and a "Dacoit" at a Congress-organized Jan Vedna rally in Purnea on February 22. Mastan has since apologised for his comments.By calling for the dharna, the NDA has effectively stepped up pressure on Chief Minister Nitish Kumar to sack his ministerial colleague.NDA leaders have fanned out across the state, and will stage dharnas at all district headquarters.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has alleged that although Chief Minister Nitish maintains that he neither frames nor protects anyone, he's shielding Mastan and not expelling him from his cabinet. "The Minister has said that he was not present at the rally on the day, so what is the purpose of him apologising for his tirade against the PM," asked senior BJP leader Sushil Modi.The BJP alleged that the nation's sentiments were hurt by the insult to the PM, and have threatened to carry on with their agitation in the street, as well as inside the Assembly. For the last three days, the NDA hasn't?allowed the Assembly to function as a result of the Mastan issue. ALSO READ:

The famous hill shrine of Lord Venkateswara in Tirumala is caught in a piquant situation as it has received over Rs 4 crore in demonetised 500 and 1,000 rupee notes from devotees in its hundi in the last two months, past the deadline for their exchange. The temple administration has written to the government and the Reserve Bank of India on the fate of the accumulated notes and was awaiting a response, a top official said today. Thousands of devotees thronging the cash-rich temple from various parts of the country continued to offer the junked currency in the hundi along with valid notes even after the deadline for exchange of demonetised notes expired on December 30. More than Rs four crore in demonetised currency had been offered in the hundi, Executive Officer of the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD), which administers the ancient shrine, D Sambasiva Rao said. "We have already written to the RBI and Government of India about the demonetised notes offered by devotees as fulfillment of their vows and are awaiting a reply," he said. It is common practice for devotees of Lord Venkateswara to keep depositing cash in tiny boxes or mud pots kept in pooja rooms in their houses over a period, and then deposit it in the temple hundi whenever they undertake the pilgrimage to Tirumala.

The tax department on Friday warned that those who undertake Benami transactions would invite Rigorous Imprisonment (RI) of up to 7 years and such violators would also stand to be charged under the normal I-T Act. In advertisements issued in leading national dailies today, the Income Tax department stated: "Do not enter into benami transactions" as the Benami Property Transactions Act, 1988, is "now in action" from November 1, 2016. "Black money is a crime against humanity. We urge every conscientious citizen to help the government in eradicating it," it said. The department also spelled out some salient features of the new Act: "Benamidar (in whose name benami property is standing), beneficiary (who actually paid consideration) and persons who abet and induce benami transactions are prosecutable and may get RI up to 7 years besides being liable to pay fine up to 25 per cent of fair market value of benami property. "It added that "persons who furnish false information to authorities under the Benami Act are prosecutable and may be imprisoned up to 5 years besides being liable to pay fine up to 10 per cent of fair market value of benami property." The department made it clear that the benami property "may be attached and confiscated by the government" and that these actions are in "addition to actions under other laws such as Income Act, 1961. BENAMI CASES "The department, since the enactment of the law last year, has registered over 230 cases and attached assets worth Rs 55 crore nationwide, which also coincided with the action against black money post demonetisation.  "A total of 235 cases and instances have been registered under the said Act by the department till mid-February this year. Show cause notices for attachment have been issued in 140 cases where benami assets worth Rs 200 crore are involved. "In 124 cases, benami assets worth more than Rs 55 crore have been provisionally attached till now," an I-T report, accessed by PTI, had said. The attached assets, officials had said, include deposits in bank accounts, agricultural and other land, flats and jewellery, among others. Post demonetisation on November 8 last year, the I-T department had carried out public advertisements and had warned people against depositing their unaccounted old currency in someone else's bank account. The I-T department is the nodal department to enforce the said Act in the country. 
Last year Google bid farewell to the iconic Nexus line-up of smartphones in favour of the Pixel and Pixel XL - the first devices designed and conceptualised in house by the company.Designed as premium smartphones and with a price to match, the Pixel and Pixel XL are designed to represent Google's version of a perfect Android smartphone, with the hardware and software seamlessly working together.While we are still a long time from the launch of the Pixel 2, latest rumors indicate that the successor to the Pixel will see key improvements in major areas such as the processor and camera and will remain a premium device.Google's head of hardware Rick Osterloh confirmed to Android Pit that the Pixel devices will stay premium and there will not be a budget Pixel phone in the near future, with the company leaving lower price points for other hardware manufacturers.Also Read:  Top 10 phones announced at MWC 2017: Nokia 6, Moto G5, LG G6 and moreHe also hinted at a fall announcement for the Pixel 2 by saying " There is an annual rhythm in the industry. So, you can count on us to follow it. You can count on a successor this year, even if you don't hear a date from me now".The current Pixel duo lack some key features which we would like to see in their successor such as dust/water resistance, optical image stabilisation, wireless charging and stereo speakers.Google could also do with reducing the size of the bezels and tweaking the current 'love it or hate it' design.The Pixel and XL come with everything expected of a flagship smartphone in today's times - 4GB of RAM, a 5.0'/5.5' AMOLED display with Gorilla Glass 4 on top, 32/128GB of internal storage and the Snapdragon 821 processor.The Google Pixel comes with Google Assistant, Google's answer to the Siris and Cortanas of the world.

China's long-time negotiator on the border talks, who retired in 2013, has said that Tawang in Arunachal Pradesh is an "inalienable" part of Tibet and that a boundary settlement would not be possible unless India agreed to make concessions in the eastern sector.But if India did so, China would also make concessions in Aksai Chin, suggested Dai Bingguo, spelling out in detail for the first time his thoughts on a solution.Dai, who was the Special Representative on the boundary issue for 15 rounds of talks until his retirement in 2013, said that India "held the key" to the settlement and that if it took into account China's concerns in the eastern sector, Beijing would similarly do so in other areas.THE DISPUTE India sees China as occupying 38,000 sq km of its territory in Aksai Chin, while China claims 90,000 sq km in Arunachal Pradesh.Dai, who recently penned his memoirs, told the Beijing-based China-India Dialogue magazine, published by the official China International Publishing Group, in an interview: "The disputed territory in the eastern sector of the China-India boundary, including Tawang, is inalienable from China's Tibet in terms of cultural background and administrative jurisdiction."He said it was not until February 1951 that "the local government of Tibet [was] forced to stop its actual administration of Tawang". "Even the British colonialists who drew the illegal 'McMahon Line' respected China's jurisdiction over Tawang," he said.Dai added: "The major reason the boundary question persists is that China's reasonable requests [in the east] have not been met"."If the Indian side takes care of China's concerns in the eastern sector of their border," he said, "the Chinese side will respond accordingly and address India's concerns elsewhere."Despite his emphasis on Tawang, Dai suggested that the 15 rounds of talks he participated in had moved both sides close to "a political settlement". His comments suggest this would involve mutual adjustments or concessions, most likely in Tawang and Aksai Chin."China and India are now standing in front of the gate towards a final settlement," he said. "The gate is a framework solution based on meaningful and mutually accepted adjustments. Now, the Indian side holds the key to the gate."The 19th round of talks was held between National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and State Councillor Yang Jiechi, Dai's successor as SR, in Beijing last April.WATCH: Why have violations on India-China border dropped in last 5 years?ALSO READ: PLA banner in Ladakh says 'You are in China' but government insists no intrusion
A new train of thought from Indian Railways will help unclog the National Capital Region's trafficpacked roads and help residents breathe easy.With the launch of a roll-on-roll-off (Ro-Ro) service to carry loaded trucks on wagons from Haryana's Gurugram to Muradnagar in Uttar Pradesh, the network plans to extend the service to private vehicles jostling with daily snarls.According to the railways, about 20,000 trucks not meant for NCR enter the region daily to travel further. Out of the total 127 entry-exit points to the city, nine major points crisscrossing the region account for 75 per cent of the commercial light and heavy duty trucks. Railway ministry officials said eight more routes will be identified soon.COMMERCIAL VEHICLES CAUSE POLLUTION IN DELHIA study by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) shows commercial vehicles entering Delhi spew close to 30 per cent of the total particulate load and 22 per cent of nitrogen oxide load from the transport sector.The Ro-Ro service aims to reduce carbon emission and congestion on the roads of the national capital region (NCR) as about 66,000 diesel-guzzling trucks pass through Delhi and its adjoining areas in a day."Nearly 80 per cent of the heavy goods vehicles entering Delhi are overloaded, but the border checkpoints don't have the mechanism to weigh these vehicles. These diesel-guzzling trucks are also the major source of pollutants PM 2.5 and PM 10 that have hit an all-time high in Delhi in recent months. Launch of Ro-Ro service is a welcome initiative but it will be beneficial only after capacity augmentation," said Dr PK Sarkar, head of transport planning at the School of Planning and Architecture.ALL ABOUT RO-RO TRAINSAlso Read

In a big relief for cola majors Pepsi and Coca Cola, the Madras High Court today revoked the order banning the two firms from using Thamirabarani river water. In November 2016, the court had banned Pepsi and Coke from using the river's water for their bottling plant on a plea that these companies were depriving farmers of their livelihood, who were unable to take up farming activities.The companies paid only 37.50 paise per 1,000 litres of water extracted and sold their beverages at a much higher cost, the PIL filed by Prabakar, Secretary of Tirunelveli Consumer Protection Association, stated.Allowing supply of Thamirabarani water to the two companies would affect lives of people in five districts, the petitioner had said and sought its sale to be stopped. SALE OF PEPSI, COKE BANNED IN TAMIL NADUA call by the Traders Federation in Tamil Nadu to ban sales of Coca Cola and Pepsi soft drinks came into effect on Wednesday with its President A M Vikrama Raja declaring drinks as 'toxic' for consumption."About 70 per cent of the (15 lakh) traders have decided to boycott the sales of Coke and Pepsi from today onwards for their toxic nature. Whatever you find on the shelves of the stores are leftover stocks and those not taken back by the (distributing) agencies," he said.Raja had earlier proposed a ban on sale of these brands at the height of pro-jallikattu protests in the state in January, where it was widely claimed that many international groups may have been behind the ban on the bull taming sport.Raja had then said that the youth and students who were part of that movement had extended their support to the cause of banning these soft drinks.Reacting to the call to boycott products of Coca-Cola and PepsiCo India, the Indian Beverage Association said it was "deeply disappointed"."This is against the proven fundamentals of robust economic growth, and against the clarion call of Make in India," it said.Both Coca Cola and Pepsi have bottling units in Tamil Nadu.WATCH: Tamil Nadu: Coke, Pepsi available in retail stores across Chennai despite ban
Question: Do you think Bhuvneshwar Kumar will replace Ishant Sharma in Bengaluru? Clarke: I think Ishant Sharma deserves to be in the team. Bhuvneshwar Kumar is a great player. He has great record against the left-handers, especially against Warner. India would want to get him in the squad. But I think Ishant surely deserves a place. CLICK TO WATCH FULL INTERVIEWQuestion: If it is a good pitch in Bengaluru, which team will have the advantage?Clarke: It is a first innings game... it is very critical to make as many runs in the first innings. Doesn't really matter if you win or lose the toss. You have to get a good score in the first innings. It sets the tone up. We have seen that now in a tough wicket in Pune. Test match is literally over in the first innings. It will be no different in Bengaluru. The wicket will deteriorate over the five days. So, on a good wicket, toss doesn't matter. You just want to score more runs in the first innings. Question: How would you get Steve Smith out?Clarke: Laughs... Smith is in unbelievable form... a lot like Virat Kohli. Some times you have to just watch and applaud when a player is in such terrific form. I think India had a lot of opportunities to get him out in Pune. There's now doubt India will have plans for each Australian batsmen. My advice to India would be to hand on to your catches. #AskMichael what advice you give to team india when they are using DRS system in test match where you have only 2 reviews for 80 overs#AskMichael Do you think India should open with Vijay and Pujara and send KL Rahul to bat at No. 3 with Kohli coming in at No. 3??NO CHANGES FOR AUSTRALIA:Clarke: I don't think Australia will make any change in Bengaluru. They have won the first Test and have the momentum. I think they will go with the same team in Bengaluru. On Ajinkya Rahane: Clarke: I think Rahane is a wonderful player... think India will give him another opportunity. I think India will make a change in Bengaluru. They will go with two spinner - R Ashwin and R Jadeja. I like to see Rahane in the team. If he is good form, that puts India in dominant position. Boria Majumdar: You had dinner with Virat Kohli last night. Give us some insights about his mind.Clarke: Virat Kohli is a strong character. He is ready and focused on the Bengaluru Test. I consider Kohli as the best batsman right now in all formats. Question: What India need to do to win in Bengaluru?Clarke: India need to combat the big four players in Bengaluru. David Warner, Steve Smith, Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood. If India can keep these four quiet in Bengaluru, they can win the Test match.?Michael Clarke: Positive for Australian cricket that they have won the first Test. But they know what challenge lies ahead. I am very impressive with what Virat Kohli said after the Pune loss.Australia now are confident that they can beat India at their own backyard.

India coach Anil Kumble on Thursday said it was important to move ahead from the embarrassing defeat in Pune and focus on the Bengaluru Test to get back to winning ways against Australia.Australia won the first Test of the four-match series by 333 runs with two days to spare and snapped India's 19-Test unbeaten run, shocking fans who expected the team to steamroll the visitors.Also watch: I consider Kohli as the best batsman right now in all formats: Michael ClarkeKumble felt his team needed to forget what happened in Pune and concentrate on making a comeback in the series in Bengaluru Test starting March 4. (Why Australia's spinners won't threaten India again in this series)"What has happened in Pune is done and dusted. We didn't play really well, didn't adapt to the conditions. Every game we need to adapt to what comes our way. Australia played well," Kumble said at the press conference ahead of the second Test."We don't need to worry about the Pune loss. Really looking to forward to this game to get back to winning ways. It was a team failure and we cannot point fingers at anyone," he added. (Can Virat Kohli's India repeat 2001 heroics vs Australia? Harbhajan Singh and Nayan Mongia recall Kolkata miracle)Skipper Virat Kohli had blamed India's batting - they were skittled for 105 and 107 - for the unexpectedly lopsided 333-run defeat. The former India captain, who took charge as the head coach in June last year, said his side will look to play as a unit in Bengaluru and tick the boxes which they failed to do in Pune. (Sourav Ganguly recalls 2001 miracle vs Australia at Eden Gardens)"Australia are a quality side. Don't think we played to our potential in Pune. We want to play to our potential in this match. Partnerhsips as batting unit, bowling unit, didn't tick those boxes. We want to tick those boxes to win the Test match," he said.Before the Pune Test, India were on an unbeaten streak at home in the 20 previous matches, while Australia entered the series on a streak of nine losses in Tests played in Asia. (Pune pitch rated 'poor' by International Cricket Council)"You can't keep winning every game. It has to come to an end. 20 games winning streak in international cricket is quite challenging. This team has able to do it. This team adapted to different situations but last game we did not and that's why we lost," Kumble said.The coach also made it clear that there was no question of dropping batsman Ajinkya Rahane from the playing XI after a single failure in Pune.Rahane got the nod in Pune ahead of Karun Nair, who slammed a triple hundred against England in the Chennai Test. However, Rahane's poor performance in Pune, where he managed to score 13 and 18 in both innings, led to questions being asked on his place in the team. (India frugal with praise for Pune tormentor Steve O'Keefe)"There's no question of dropping Ajinkya Rahane. He has scored well and has extremely successful. We still haven't discussed the team composition. It is unfortunate that Karun Nair has missed out. That's how the team composition goes. "That's the beauty about this group. Whoever has come in, has done really well. Unfortunate for Karun, he is a class act. Our aim is to win every game," he said.
Bowing to pressure from citizens and green activists, the Karnataka government today abandoned the controversial steel flyover project in the city, saving about 800 trees from facing the axe."The steel flyover will not be constructed as the project has been cancelled," Bengaluru Development Minister KJ George said.The Chennai bench of the National Green Tribunal on October 28, 2016 stayed the 6.9-km project from Chalukya Circle in the city centre to Hebbal junction in the northern suburb, connecting the international airport road at Devanahalli and National Highway 4 towards Hyderabad.The state-run Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) was the nodal agency for the Rs 1,761-crore project and engineering and construction major L&T was to execute it, as its lowest bidder in a global tender.The expensive six-lane project, ostensibly meant to ease the gridlock on the busy thoroughfare, faced vehement opposition from civic society and urban experts as it would have resulted in the loss of about 800 trees and their green canopy en-route to the city's outskirts.State's former Additional Chief Secretary VBalasubramanian and Citizens Action Forum President N.S. Mukunda jointly filed the writ petition before the Tribunal against the BDA from executing the project as it would have caused environmental damage to the garden city.The Tribunal bench, headed by Justice M Chokalingam and expert member PS Rao, passed an interim order, restraining the state government from going ahead with the project till the petitioners' concerns were heard and addressed."Neither the state government nor BDA considered alternative routes, no study was done to confirm if the steel bridge was the best option, no permission was taken to cut 800 trees and no public hearings were conducted before awarding the project to a private firm," claimed the petitioners then.
The Nintendo Switch is a mixed-use, family friendly console and its games come on little proprietary memory cards. Those cards have been with reviewers for a week or so now and, while information about the games on them may still be embargoed, it has emerged the cartridges themselves taste horrendously bitter.History does not definitively record who first thought it a necessary part of their review to lick one, but someone did. Kids (and game reviewers?) being kids, and therefore inclined to stick anything they can in their mouths, Nintendo confirmed it has tried to do worried parents everywhere a favour and reduce the chances of the SD card-sized cartridges from being swallowed.A Nintendo spokesperson told gaming site Kotaku: ?To avoid the possibility of accidental ingestion, keep the game card away from young children. A bittering agent (denatonium benzoate) has also been applied to the game card.? This bittering agent ?is non-toxic?, it stresses.Denatonium is one of the extremely bitter tasting chemicals used in anti-nail biting treatments, among other things. The Guardian?s Alex Hern taste-tested the Switch launch title The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and can report, it is indeed ?gross?.I just licked Zelda because of this and yup, can confirm: is gross https://t.co/4x3TQn9Ym9?I wasn?t expecting the rumours to be true, so took a fairly meaty lick of the top half of the cartridge, and it rapidly proved to be a mistake,? Hern said. ?I?ve heard the compound described as ?bitter?, but that doesn?t really do it justice: it?s just a pure, concentrated dose of unpleasantness, and it lingers in your tastebuds for an uncomfortably long time.?

In fact, it will become a leading edge practice worldwide," Mittal told PTI in an interview. J S Deepak, as the Telecom Secretary, a couple of days ago said the government is looking at making spectrum auction an annual event and will reach out to sector regulator Trai for its recommendations. He had said the government plans to provide industry with an option to buy spectrum every year irrespective of their interest so that there is never a shortage of spectrum in providing quality mobile services. Deepak, a 1982-batch IAS officer from Uttar Pradesh, who at present is at the World Mobile Congress in Barcelona, has been shifted with "immediate effect" from the telecom ministry and made officer on special duty in the commerce department. Mittal recently pitched for affordability in spectrum pricing that has gone "out of control" in the last few years, saying the spectrum surplus industry will not need an airwave auction at least in 2017-18. He, however, has said that even though telecom operators are bleeding with the entrance of a new service provider, they will need to increase investment in networks to handle competition. "You have to accelerate market spends. You need to put more capex. We have done 85,000 base stations last year, 80,000 base stations this year. This is largest rollout anywhere in the world. There will be more investment on 4G side," Mittal said. Bharti Airtel had reported an over 54 per cent fall in net profit at Rs 503.7 crore for the December quarter due to what it had termed as "turbulence from predatory pricing by a new operator". The Indian telecom czar said Bharti Airtels balancesheet remains "healthy and strong" and he does not think Bharti will go into losses under competitive pressure although one can "never say never". He maintained that with improvement in technology, the cost of network is not linear. Mittal further said Huawei and ZTE have a massive mimo technology using which one can quadruple or probably go up to 8 times of existing capacities in the spectrum. "Nice good innovation is happening on the network side where you can generate nice good capacities than in the past. Technology is also coming to help. Its not that if I have got 2000 TB of capacity and I have to move to 5000, I have to double my investments. Its probably 20 per cent more," Mittal said. 
New Delhi, Mar 2 (PTI) The National Human Rights Commission has issued a notice to Delhi government over reports of a dead rat being found in a mid-day meal served to students at a school in south east Delhis Deoli area. The Commission today said it has taken suo motu cognisance of the reports, issued the notice to the Chief Secretary, and sought detailed report in the matter within four weeks, including the action taken against the agencies concerned. Nine students of Government Boys Senior Secondary School were taken ill on February 16 after consuming midday meal which allegedly had a dead rat in it. The students were rushed to Madan Mohan Malviya Hospital. Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia had subsequently directed the Chief Secretary to monitor cooking of mid-day meals served in Delhi schools. Police had also lodged an FIR against two operators of an NGO who supplied mid-day meals to the school in Deoli. "The Commission has observed that occurrence of such an incident, if true, amounts to violation of right to life of the children. It indicates towards serious lapse on part of the concerned agencies," the NHRC said in a statement.

She began drinking at the age of 16, but it's been 68 days since Pooja Bhatt touched a drop of alcohol. It was only recently that Pooja opened up about his alcohol addiction and how she overcame it. In an interview to Mid-Day, Bhatt girl revealed that she pulled the plug on alcohol last December and has been sober ever since. And for her it's a way of catharsis to talk about her alcohol problem in public. "I want to bust the stigma attached to alcoholism in our country. Women particularly are discouraged from seeking help because it's a matter of shame for the family. We don't share our pain or frailties, we cover our weaknesses and it becomes a cancer," she told the daily. Although, she is happy to be where she is now, it has not been an easy journey for Pooja. "Luckily, I pulled the plug before it became impossible for me to stop. I'm in the pink of health except for the weight I put on because I'm now a stressful producer. But being the daughter of an alcoholic makes you four times more susceptible to becoming one," she added. But daddy Bhatt quit drinking years ago.?After being in love with her bottle for over decades, it was text message from her dad Mahesh Bhatt which made her rethink. During one the chats, Mahesh told Pooja that if she loves him, then she should love herself too as he lives in her. And this text struck a chord with Pooja and she decided to take the reigns in her hands. She also revealed that being brought up in an Anglo-Indian environment, it was normal for wine to be passed around the table and beer opened on Sunday. She added that even in the film industry there were people drinking copiously."Alcohol is comforting, it colours your evening. It's a socially accepted narcotic even at business lunches and in the boardroom. Also, living in a fast-paced city, being in a high-stress profession, it becomes a reason to celebrate and cope with failure. Your film is a hit, you bathe in champagne, it flops, a single malt lessens the pain," she added. But she was no ready to go on like this forever and decided to put her foot down. "I was 45 and if I wanted to give myself 10 years of living, I had to quit now before I drank myself to the grave. I had to reclaim the sharper, brighter me which had got watered down," she added. 
Tainted Indian speedster S. Sreesanth has approached the Kerala High Court with a petition seeking the lifting of the ban imposed by the BCCI, even after a Delhi court exonerated him in the spot-fixing case. (Sreesanth writes to BCCI administrator Vinod Rai for revocation of ban)His stock fell after he was arrested in the midst of the 2013 edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL) and was lodged at the Tihar jail. (Sreesanth denied permission to play in Scotland Premier League)The 34-year-old Sreesanth, who hails from here, had written to former Comptroller and Auditor General Vinod Rai last month, who heads the Supreme Court-appointed Committee of Administrators (CoA) of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), seeking justice as he has lost four years.In his petition that was filed on Wednesday, Sreesanth said that the BCCI disciplinary committee based their report on the Delhi police report.He pointed out that in 2015, Delhi court exonerated him and two other players in the case registered by the Delhi Police which invoked the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) and hence his life ban should be lifted.Sreesanth was crestfallen when the outgoing leadership of the BCCI treated him, especially denying him an NOC to play in this year's edition of the Scotland Cricket league.
We have always been fascinated by the erstwhile Indian royal families as well as their present day descendants. Besides their opulent lifestyle and diverse cultural heritage, tales of royal repast often include mention of secret recipes, family favourites and a rich culinary repertoire. Here's some good news: We will soon have an opportunity to 'Dine with Royalty' during a three-day grand event organized by eatwithIndia, the group synonymous with promoting regional Indian cuisine by curating unique dining experiences, mostly at homes of people who are proud to showcase their family food.  Scheduled for October 2017, Dine with Royalty will have 20 royal families presenting their cuisines in the capital during the first festival of its kind. Six luxury tents would be set up, each representing the heritage of a princely state where members of different royal families will play host during the meal. Also read: Ganga-Jamuni tehzeeb is the secret behind the exquisite cuisine of Benaras Each tent will serve 35 guests at a time, for lunch and dinner. There will also be special performances by local artistes of each region to make the entire experience more special. To maintain the intimacy of the experience all the event tickets will be pre-booked, and no walk-ins will be entertained.   The curtain raiser for the forthcoming festival was recently held at the Embassy of Belgium. The evening started with a panel discussion by stalwarts of culinary history including Pushpesh Pant, food historian, Neha Prasada, author of 'Dining with the Maharajas: A Thousand Years of Culinary Tradition', Nawab Kazim Ali Khan, Nawab of Rampur, Tikaraj Aishwarya Chandra Katoch, 489th descendant of the royal Katoch clan, eminent food writer Sourish Bhattacharya and Sonal Saxena, co-founder eatwithIndia. This was followed by a mesmerizing qawwali performance by the Nizami Brothers. The highlight of the evening, as expected, was the food! 
Delhiites may soon look forward to a soothing Metro commute during rush hours.The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation has decided to start playing music in stations on the New Delhi-Dwarka airport line and plans to extend it inside trains and across its network gradually, depending on user feedback.The decision to roll out instrumental music on the airport line ? used by an average of 40,000 people a day ? came after a public survey last year.?As per the survey, 80% of the people desired to have light music in the station premises, the modalities for which are being worked out,? said a Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) official.Sources say the facility may be rolled out in a month or two and the DMRC has already applied for a license from the Indian Performing Right Society and Phonographic Performance Limited. Depending on feedback, the music may soon be extended inside trains.?These two companies give license if a public transport facility wants to play music. We have public address system in the entire metro network and playing music won?t be a problem,? the official added. ?The music will be on the lines of what plays in flights so that it doesn?t annoy the passenger. Once we get the license, the facility will start at the airport line stations.?The music is part of a turnaround in the airport line after the DMRC took over in June 2013. The daily ridership jumped from 9,000 to 40,000. Many VIPs including Union minister M Venkaiah Naidu, travelled on the line and have even tweeted photos. To attract passengers, the DMRC has revised the fares twice and made several other changes to ensure more people use this line. The maximum fare has been reduced to R 60 from R 180 and the minimum is now R 10 against r 30 in 2013.On August 12, the ridership reached a peak of 50,077. Passengers traveling with Air India and Jet Airways can also check-in from New Delhi and Shivaji stadium metro station.
A Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) leader from Madhya Pradesh has held Kerala Chief Minister and senior Left leader Pinarayi Vijayan responsible for the killing of its members in the state and has announced a reward of Rs one crore for his head.Dr Chandrawat, the RSS Pramukh in Ujjain, said he would even sell his property if he has to give the reward for Vijayan's head. The remarks were made in the presence of MP Chintamani Malviya and MLA Mohan Yadav during an event in Ujjain.Kerala has always witnessed political murders, where the RSS-BJP and the CPM have lost several of their cadres. Last month, the death of BJP leader Santhosh was the eighth murder to have taken place after the Vijayan government took over in May, 2016.The RSS is the ideological fountainhead of the BJP.Last week, Vijayan had said right-wing organisations, including the RSS, have been trying to divide the country for the last several years. "The RSS has adopted the organisational structure of Mussolini and the ideology of Hitler. The two dictators had terrorised the world," he had said.Vijayan said Nathuram Godse, who assassinated Mahatma Gandhi, was a weapon in the hands of the RSS. The assassination was the result of a conspiracy, he alleged."In India, the RSS has now identified Muslims, Christians and Communists as their internal enemies and were carrying out attacks to eliminate them," Vijayan had said.
All schools in Kashmir reopened today after an on and off break for eight months, due to the unrest the Valley found itself in after Burhan Wani's encounter.

Dehradun, Mar 1 (PTI) Uttarakhand Governor K K Paul today inaugurated the 29th edition of the InternationaI Yoga Festival at Rishikesh, and said the event was growing in stature and helping the state become a sought-after destination for spiritual tourism. "It is from Devbhumi Uttarakhand that Yoga originated and has now spread in the entire world. It is wonderful to see, year after year, so many people from across the world and from every walk of life gather here to celebrate this festival of Yoga and Spirituality," he said. The week-long event, jointly organised by the AYUSH ministry, Uttarakhand Tourism Development Board, Parmarth Niketan and Garhwal Mandal Vikas Nigam, was inaugurated at Parmarth Niketan along the banks of the Ganges river. "It is only apt that the festival coincides with the spring season when the holy Ganga has clear pristine water from the snows which have just begun to melt in the Himalayas and there is fragrance of spring flowers in the air," the Governor said. 
The BJP office in Manipur's Imphal was ransacked by some miscreants, who allegedly belong to the Congress. Although there were not many people in the office at the time of the attack as most of the workers were out in the city for organising and coordinating rallies. The attackers broke the furniture and left entire office in an extremely bad condition. The attackers were allegedly shouting slogans against the BJP.The party said that it will take up the matter in the public also instead of just reporting the incident to the police.BJP party leaders said that the Congress is seeing the writing on the wall, and is hence behaving in such desperate ways. The party also said that these acts will not reduce the will of the BJP and its supporters but will will instead make it stronger.The Congress has stayed away from commenting on the issue so far.Also read: Manipur election: UNC vows to fight against Congress, declares support for BJP ally Naga People's Front
Junior home minister Kiren Rijiju refueled a raging debate on nationalism, tweeting on Wednesday a video of an Indian Army soldier lecturing against a section of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) students and supporters of the 2001 Parliament attack convict.The minister, who is a BJP parliamentarian from Arunachal Pradesh, drew flak on Monday when he posted an acerbic tweet against Delhi University student Gurmehar Kaur, an army martyr?s daughter, for broadcasting her dislike for the right-wing ABVP.Rijiju dug up an old video of soldier Shriram Gorde to hit out at his critics.?Pain runs deeper than the Ocean. Very sad that our jawans are forced to speak with heavy heart,? he wrote in his message to go with the video.Pain runs deeper than the Ocean. Very sad that our jawans are forced to speak with heavy heart. pic.twitter.com/1AbLScDnor? Kiren Rijiju (@KirenRijiju) March 1, 2017Gorde is seen in the video speaking against sympathisers of the 2001 Parliament attack convict Afzal Guru, who was hanged in February 2013, JNU students who held a rally during his death anniversary last year, and critics of the army?s ?surgical strike? last September against militants holed up in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.?We don?t feel sad to see Afzal Guru being hanged. But we are sad to see people chant slogans that ?Afzal hum sharminda hai, tere qatil zinda hai? (Afzal we are ashamed that your killer is still alive),? he says in the footage, referring to the controversial event at JNU that triggered a nationwide debate on nationalism.The video is viewed as an attempt to garner public support against opposition parties and a section of Delhi University students who have been at loggerheads with the BJP-backed ABVP, which has been accused of last week?s campus violence over an invite to two JNU students for a seminar in Ramjas College.?We feel sad when thousands of people come out in support of such people (backers of Guru). I feel sad when thousands of people join the funeral procession of a terrorist,? says the soldier enlisted in 9 Maratha Infantry and posted in Gujarat?s Jamnagar.The video was shot at an annual weapons display for schoolchildren on December 28 last year.Gorde been attending the function for the past two years and gave a speech on each of the occasions, he said over the phone to Hindustan Times.?I speak from the heart. Whatever I feel about the current situation of the country, I said in my speech. If the current atmosphere continues, the country may face another Partition. I expressed my pain,? he said, explaining why he lectured on highly political and sensitive subjects that a soldier is not supposed to speak about, especially in public.?I am a soldier for the past 13 years. I know there is code of conduct for a military man but I said what I had to say. It was cultural programme, and I just expressed what I felt deep in my heart,? Gorde said.A BSF soldier was strictly censured after he posted in January videos on Facebook showing poor quality food at his unit in Jammu and Kashmir, and accused senior officers of corruption in the supply of military rations.But Gorde appears to have Union minister Rijiju?s support for now.
After Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao moved into a sprawling estate of nine acres worth nearly Rs 50 crore in Hyderabad, all state legislators are expected to follow suit. The Telangana government is building office-cum-residence bungalows for all MLAs, which will be constructed in their constituencies within a 500 square yard area. These 'camp offices' for all 117 legislatures will be constructed on a budget of Rs 1 crore each. The state government has appointed the State Roads and Buildings Department for the work, whereas all district collectors have been asked to identify suitable land in each constituency. According to reports, the office cum residence bungalows will be equipped with facilities like- broadband network, digital video conference facilities among others. The state's first MLA camp office-cum-residence is all set to be inaugurated at the Parkala constituency of Warangal district on March 2.Sources suggest, it was constructed within six months at a budget of Rs 68 crores.Meanwhile, CM Rao's flagship two-bedroom house programme for poor is still battling cash crunch and land crisis.
The Jammu and Kashmir Police has busted a big plot of Pakistan-based terrorists to launch attacks in the Valley. The police recovered a huge cache of arms and ammunition concealed in a truck carrying goods from Chakoti, Muzafarabad in Pakistan occupied Kashmir or PoK. The incident comes six months after the Uri attack in which 17 soldiers were martyred.The cross LoC trade on Chakoti-Uri border has been under radar of intelligence and security agencies. According to intel reports, terror masterminds are using the trade of almonds at the LoC to push fake Indian currency notes, arms into Indian side of the border. Acting on specific inputs, J&K Police nabbed a truck driver, who had gone to Chakoti for delivery of goods to PoK, from Kulgam. The driver named Irshad Ahmad Mantoo returned with arms and ammunitions meant to be transferred to terrorist operating in the Valley. The arms were concealed in a cavity designed specially inside the truck. NIA which is investigating cross loC trade is sending a team to URI, after arrest of a truck driver smuggling arms. NIA will grill mantoo with regards to the case of terror funding. "On a specific information about some arms and ammunition being smuggled across LoC through some goods truck meant to carry Cross-LoC trade merchandise, a naka was put by Baramulla Police in Uri area. The incoming goods-laden trucks which had gone to Chakoti area of PoK were searched and arms and ammunition were recovered," DIG North Kashmir Nitish Kumar told India Today.The driver of the truck (JK03B 1586) Mantoo has been arrested under various sections of Ranbir Penal Code and?Unlawful Activities Prevention Act has been registered at Uri police station. Further investigation into the matter is on. HOW TERROR GROUPS ARE USING ALMOND TRADE FOR SMUGGLING ARMS In December 2016, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) had registered a large scale transfer of funds from Pakistan to India through the import of California Almonds (badam giri) via the Cross-LoC trade mechanism through the Trade Facilitation Centres (TFCs) located at Salamabad, Uri, District Baramulla and Chakkan-da-Bagh in Poonch district. This is in gross violation of the State policy of prohibition on trade in 'third-party origin goods' through this mechanism and information indicated that these funds are being used for fomenting terrorism and separatism in Jammu and Kashmir. There are an estimated 400 traders and 300 traders on both designated trading Centres. At least 50 of them are currently under scrutiny.The routes were opened as part of confidence building measures between India and Pakistan and also to boost direct trade between Jammu and Kashmir and PoK in 2008. The cross-LoC trade is duty-free bartertrade. But only those items can be brought in or sent that are produced in either in Jammu and Kashmir or PoK.(With inputs from Ashraf Wani in Srinagar) ALSO READ:?
Los Angeles, Mar 1 (PTI) Singer Rihanna has been honoured with the 2017 Harvard Humanitarian of the Year award. The 29-year-old singer was honoured by the Harvard Foundation for Intercultural and Race Relations for her work in her native island of Barbados and the charities she has founded over the years, according to The Hollywood Reporter. In a ceremony held on Tuesday, Rihanna thanked the university for the honour and delivered an inspiring speech. "So I made it to Harvard. Never thought Id be able to say that in my life, but it feels good," Rihanna said as she jokingly flipped her hair. "I wonder how many 25 cents I could save up to save all the kids in Africa. And I would say to myself, When I grow up and I get rich, Im gonna save kids all over the world. I just didnt know I would be in a position to do that by the time I was a teenager," she added explaining that she has had a passion for helping people since she was a young girl watching commercials about how a quarter could help save a childs life. 

Taarak Mehta, the popular Gujarati columnist, humorist and playwright, passed away at the age of 87 today.

The show became a household favourite because of its witty take on everyday, ordinary issues.
Tokyo, Feb 27 (PTI) Scientists have created a highly flexible material that is tougher than steel, by combining hydrogels with woven glass fibre fabric, which may have a wide range of potential applications. Efforts are currently underway around the world to create materials that are friendly to both society and the environment. Among them are those that comprise different materials, which exhibit the merits of each component. Researchers from Hokkaido University in Japan focused on creating a reinforced material using hydrogels. Though such a substance has potential as a structural biomaterial, up until now no material reliable and strong enough for long-term use has been produced. To address the problem, the team combined hydrogels containing high levels of water with glass fibre fabric to create bendable, yet tough materials, employing the same method used to produce reinforced plastics. Researchers found that a combination of polyampholyte (PA) gels, a type of hydrogel they developed earlier, and glass fibre fabric with a single fibre measuring around 10 micrometres in diameter produced a strong, tensile material. The procedure to make the material is simply to immerse the fabric in PA precursor solutions for polymerisation. When used alone, the fibre-reinforced hydrogels developed by the team are 25 times tougher than glass fibre fabric, and 100 times tougher than hydrogels - in terms of the energy required to destroy them. Combining these materials enables a synergistic toughening. The team theorises that toughness is increased by dynamic ionic bonds between the fibre and hydrogels, and within the hydrogels, as the fibres toughness increases in relation to that of the hydrogels. Consequently, the newly developed hydrogels are 5 times tougher compared to carbon steel. "The fibre-reinforced hydrogels, with a 40 per cent water level, are environmentally friendly," said Jian Ping Gong, from Hokkaido University in Japan. 
Washington, Feb 27 (PTI) NASA plans to send its first robotic spacecraft to the Sun next year that is slated to get within six million kilometres of the blazing star to probe its atmosphere. Humans have sent spacecraft to the Moon, Mars and even distant interstellar space. Now, NASA plans to launch the Solar Probe Plus mission to the Sun which is about 149 million kilometres from the Earth. "This is going to be our first mission to fly to the Sun," said Eric Christian, a NASA research scientist at Goddard Space Flight Centre. "We cant get to the very surface of the Sun," but the mission will get close enough to answer three important questions, Christian said. First, the mission will hopefully unveil why the surface of the Sun, called the photosphere, is not as hot as its atmosphere, called the corona. According to NASA, the surface temperature of the Sun is only about 5,500 degrees Celsius. However, the atmosphere above it is a sizzling two million degrees Celsius. "You would think the farther away you get from a heat source, you would get colder. Why the atmosphere is hotter than the surface is a big puzzle," Christian said. The scientists also want to know how solar wind gets its speed, Live Science reported. "The Sun blows a stream of charged particles in all directions at a million miles an hour. But we do not understand how that gets accelerated," he said. 
Bihar's minister for excise and prohibition Abdul Jalil Mastan has kicked up a controversy after his video abusing Prime Minister Narendra Modi and calling him a "dacoit" went viral. In the video, the minister allegedly asked the crowd to beat the photograph of the Prime Minister with slippers.The video was shot on February 22 when Mastan, a Congress leader, was addressing a Jan Vedna rally against demonetisation in his constituency of Amour in Purnia district.As the BJP leaders protested in the Assembly demanding the minister's expulsion from the cabinet, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar condemned the remarks and called them wrong.Senior BJP leader and former deputy chief minister of Bihar Sushil Modi said "regret by CM Nitish is not enough and Mastan should be sacked from the cabinet".Mastan, in the eye of a major political storm, apologised for his remarks. "I apologise if my statements have hurt anyone," the minister said. ALSO READ:Modi is Trump's parallel; Economy will slip by 1.2-1.3 per cent: Chidambaram at Budget Aaj Tak

A Kochi-bound Air India flight was forced to make an emergency landing in New Delhi soon after its take-off from the Indira Gandhi International Airport as the engineers had failed to remove pins from the landing gear, a spokesperson said today.Two engineers have been taken off duty pending inquiry after they 'forgot' to remove the pins last morning, an Air India spokesperson said.WHAT HAPPENEDThe AI 933 Delhi-Cochin-Dubai plane with 234 passengers onboard took off from the Indira Gandhi International Airport yesterday at 5:36 am but was forced to return and make an emergency landing 40 minutes later after the pilot was unable to retract the wheels.
Washington, Feb 28 (PTI) Scientists have developed a novel computer method called ZeitZeiger that uses a sample of blood to accurately predict circadian time - the time of day according to a persons body clock. "Our study demonstrates a method for predicting a persons internal time of day that could eventually be used to help diagnose and monitor circadian- and sleep-related disorders, and also to personalise treatments," said Jake Hughey from Vanderbilt University in the US. "This is the first study to use genome-wide expression data from many individuals to develop a biomarker of the circadian clock in human blood," Hughey said. "Previous efforts to monitor the circadian clock in human tissues were based on a small number of individuals and/or a small set of pre-selected genes. Our method, ZeitZeiger, uses 15 genes from across the human genome to predict circadian time," he said. The researchers were surprised to find that 13 out of these 15 genes were not core genes of the human circadian clock. Core genes are necessary for the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms. They can be compared to the gears of a mechanical watch. "Most of the genes that were selected for ZeitZeiger seem to be outputs of the clock; that is they are not the gears controlling the clock, but the hands telling the time. "This shows that when given data for almost every gene in the genome, the algorithm can figure out which set of genes gives the best predictions, even if they are not core clock genes," Hughey said. In addition to predicting circadian time, the researchers demonstrated that ZeitZeiger can also be used to show how disruptions to sleep-wake and light-dark cycles affect the circadian clock. The rhythms produced by the circadian clock differ widely between individuals at any given time of day and they are often disrupted by modern environments, for example due to shift work or reduced exposure to sunlight. Circadian dysfunction is linked to conditions such as cancer, depressive disorder and obesity. Knowledge of an individuals circadian rhythms could be used to optimise the timing of therapeutic interventions, which is known as chronotherapy. 
The Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) sacked on Wednesday two members who were arrested for allegedly thrashing students in Delhi University?s north campus after a protest march a day ago.The group ? the student wing of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh ? also asked police to take stern action against the duo, Prashant Mishra and Vinayak Sharma.?The two students did not adhere to the rules of the ABVP and indulged in violence. Their membership from the party has been cancelled. We have also ordered an inquiry into the incident,? read a press statement from the group?s national media convener Saket Bahuguna.?We will co-ordinate with the police and demand strict action against them.?The two expelled ABVP members are accused of beating up Aman Sinha, a student of Jawaharlal Nehru University and a member of the left-leaning All India Students Association, and two others near Patel Chest Institute in north campus.The alleged attack came towards the end of a march that saw hundreds of students and teachers from various colleges and universities hit the streets to protest against campus violence. Several political leaders and student political groups joined the protest.The university has been simmering for a week after ABVP members refused to allow JNU students Umar Khalid and Shehla Rashid from speaking at a seminar in Ramjas College. Soon after, clashes broke out between the ABVP and other parties ? with many students thrashed in the melee that followed.Delhi Police was also accused of beating up students and journalists and giving ABVP members a free hand. Hours after the clash last Wednesday, police registered a case and transferred it to the crime branch. Three police officers were also suspended for attacking journalists and students. 
The number of registered rape cases in Madhya Pradesh do not reflect the true picture of crime against women in the state, MP Home Minister Bhupendra Singh said on Tuesday."We are sensitive towards women and have directed the police to register FIRs in all cases that are reported. So the figures may show a high number but the actual picture is something else as in many cases women either change their statement in court or retract allegations," Singh told India Today.On Monday, Bhupendra Singh in a written reply to a question asked by Congress MLA Ram Nivas Rawat in the state Vidhan Sabha said that 4,527 cases of rape were reported from across the state in the past one year. Of these 13 women were killed after they were raped, while 14 committed suicide. Of the 4,527 women who were raped 611 belonged to the scheduled caste category, 662 were from the Scheduled Tribe category?and 750 women were from the OBC category. Incidentally, National Crime Records Bureau data states that there 4, 391 cases reported from the state.The home minister's defence of rape figures comes at a time when BJP leaders in Morena and Mandsaur have been charged with outraging the modesty of women. In Mandsaur, a middle aged woman tried to do self immolation outside the district collector's office on Monday alleging police was not registering?her complaint against a BJP leader who had allegedly outraged he modesty on Sunday.BJP LEADERS BOOKED In Morena, another women levelled rape charges against a block level BJP leader on Tuesday around the same time when the home minister was busy justifying the high rape figures across the state. The Morena victim has alleged she was taken to a lonely place on the pretext of getting her a ration card and was raped by the BJP leader for two days.In Chhattarpur, a 75 year-old woman who was raped by her tenant on Sunday is battling for her life in a Gwalior Hospital.In the state capital Bhopal, a three year old girl was allegedly raped by the director of a high profile play school on February 23. The victim's parents have alleged that police did not register a case till February 27 and that the accused was yet to be arrested.India Today cited all the cases quoted above to the state home minister and to which he replied?by saying that the police was doing its job and that no rapist would be spared.
Intelligence agencies say stone-throwing protests in Kashmir, which picked up after militant leader Burhan Wani was killed in an encounter with security forces last July, have now spread to rural regions.Authorities are worried as they say the crowds in the countryside are more belligerent. An officer says boys as young as 4 and 5 are participating in the stone- pelting.After being caught, many of these kids reveal that they have no idea what they are involved in. The J&K Police have appealed to parents to ensure that they are not drawn into disruptive activities by militants or overground workers funded by Pakistani agencies.Young boys took to throwing stones in mass demonstrations that rocked Kashmir Valley in 2008 and 2010. Since then, it has become a popular way for youths to express their anger against the government, and authorities have been constantly looking to stamp out any repeat.Many children were taken into custody for stone-pelting in 2010 but let out after the state government gave them amnesty.MANY MLAS SCARED TO VENTURE OUT IN THEIR OWN CONSTITUENCIES Though the magnitude of the problem has increased manifold, security forces feel that it is the lack of the PDP-BJP administration's ability to reach out to the people that has angered them more. Many of the MLAs are scared to venture out in their own constituencies due to fear of assault. Chief minister Mehbooba Mufti has visited several locations, said a source, but she has been ringed by security, rendering the trips almost futile. Another officer said, "Since her election from Anantnag, the CM has not been seen here." A video of a security forces-militant encounter this year in Hajin village of J&K has been doing the rounds not just in the state but also among soldiers. The pictures are stark- crowds from the area running after an army truck even as the force suffered a casualty. Major Satish Dahiya was killed in the gun battle. But it is the stone-pelting, which has worried the security forces.Many in the forces feel the problem is not limited to law and order and there has been only a weak attempt to broker peace in the region with politicians spewing mistrust.
Varanasi, Feb 28 (PTI) Rashtriya Janata Dal supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav today sought to liken BJP-led NDA governments last November demonetisation decision with infamous mid-1970s Emergency-era phenomena of forced nasbandi (sterilisation). "It was not notebandi but nasbandi, carried out by the Modi government on crores of people, who were forced to stand in queue for withdrawing their own money from the banks," said Lalu, launching a scathing attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Lalu attacked Modi while addressing an election campaign rally here in support the SP-Congress alliance candidate and dubbed the Prime Minister as twin brother of US President Donald Trump, saying "no one knows what will the two do next." Lalu dubbed Modi Trumps "twin brother," while seeking to describe Congress president Sonia Gandhi as bahu (the daughter-in-law) of the country. "Sonia Gandhi is the bahu (daughter-in-law) of India, she is no more a foreigner for us," he said attacking the PM and inadvertently raking up Gandhis foreign origin issue. It was not clear what made Lalu suddenly assert Gandhis identity as an Indian. 
Australia paceman Mitchell Starc is bracing for a heavier workload in the second Test against India having hardly broken a sweat in his team's romp in the series opener in Pune.CLICK TO WATCH FULL VIDEOWith spin twins Steve O'Keefe and Nathan Lyon claiming 17 of the 20 Indian wickets, Starc and pace colleague Josh Hazlewood bowled a combined 20 overs as Australia triumphed by 333 runs inside three days to go 1-0 up in the four-test series."It's amazing. I think it's making up for the summer Josh and I had," Starc told reporters on Tuesday."The spinners bowled really well and the pitch didn't have much in it for Josh and me. There was very minimal natural swing because it was so abrasive and it didn't really go too much reverse. (Also read: Steve O'Keefe akin to reliable Korean car: Monty Panesar)"But when Steve's taking that many wickets and Nathan's bowling really well there's not really much need for us on that wicket."World number one India were all out for 105 in the first innings and managed only two more in the second before succumbing to a crushing defeat that snapped their 19-test unbeaten streak. (Also read: Steve O'Keefe surprised by India's batting collapse in Pune Test)With the smarting hosts unlikely to repeat the mistake of rolling out another turning track at Bengaluru, Starc reckoned he and Hazlewood would have to shoulder more responsibility in the match starting on Saturday."I'm sure it will be a pretty dry wicket again, so that'll probably help reverse swing there and it's something we'll be working hard at all the time in the nets," said the 27-year-old.

Fans who turned up to watch a MS Dhoni special returned disappointed even as Jharkhand cruised to a comfortable seven-wicket win over Services for their second victory in the Vijay Hazare Trophy on Tuesday.Chasing a stiff 277, Jharkhand did not require services of their captain 'cool' as Saurabh Tiwary (102 not out off 103 balls; 3x4, 6x6) and Ishank Jaggi (116 not out off 92 balls; 10x4, 4x6) put together an unbroken 214-run partnership to script a fluent chase with 22 balls to spare.He may not have played a role with the bat but Dhoni's tips during the drinks break played a big role in their win, Jaggi later revealed. (MS Dhoni's century lights up Eden Gardens)"Mahi bhai advised us to play in a calm and composed manner. He told us, 'If you play with patience runs will come. It's about staying there and finish the game'," Jaggi said.The lefthander Tiwary added: "We played without any pressure well aware of the fact that MS comes next."Jharkhand had a shaky build-up and were reduced to 65/3 inside 17 overs but poor fielding from Services let the duo build on a firm stand. Yet to open his account, Tiwary was dropped at mid-off by Shakti Malviya off Poonam Poonia, while Jaggi got a reprieve on 25.At 107/3 midway into their innings, the match tilted heavily in favour of Services with required run rate going past six. (MS Dhoni's hundred helps Jharkhand sink Chhattisgarh in Vijay Hazare Trophy)It was an ideal situation for the 'finisher' Dhoni as the crowd kept on shouting his name in anticipation but Tiwary and Jaggi did not take a step wrong and complemented each other in their solid left-right combination.They kept rotating strikes and got an odd boundary or six in every over providing a calm assurance in the dressing room as the crowd started to become frustrated and shouted 'Saurabh Tiwary Hai Hai'.Tiwary however took it in a positive spirit and said: "We must understand that they're emotional as Mahi bhai never played here...Being a professional I did not mind. We were subjected to much more sledging on the field."Having slowly built their innings, the duo took charge of the show and Jaggi completed his sixth List A century in 82 balls with a boundary in the 42nd over, while Tiwary followed suit reaching his second List A hundred in 100 balls. (Vijay Hazare Trophy: MS Dhoni's 43 goes in vain as Karnataka beat Jharkhand)Having trolled by the crowd in his exquisite knock, Tiwary later acknowledged his hundred to the crowd gesturing that 'keep shouting'.But Dhoni returned on the field during the customary handshake after the win and walked midway on to the boundary rope near the spectators and waved at them.Thousands gathered outside the venue unable to enter, while a few hundreds managed to get in with passes, while rooftops of the residential buildings and a school surrounding the stadium wore a packed look since 9 am in a never-before atmosphere.But the only action they could have of Dhoni was his two run-outs and a caught-behind dismissal on a flat deck of Bengal Cricket Academy in the small industrial township of Kalyani about 50 kilometres from Kolkata.Earlier Services could not capitalise on a solid 104-run opening partnership between Gaurav Kochar (50) and Nakul Verma (48) to be restricted for 276/9.Fresh from his 124 against Saurashtra here two days ago, Verma missed a half-century narrowly when Vikash Singh gave the first breakthrough of the day in the 20th over.Dhoni produced a spectacular runout to dismiss Abhijit Salvi (31) before his caught behind claimed the skipper Soumya Swain's wicket for 12 to reduce them to 158/4 in 32nd over.Salvi played on the legside for a single but Dhoni was quick to gather the ball and hit the stumps directly at the opposite end.But it was Shamser Yadav and Rahul Singh who added a quick 84-run for the fifth wicket from 13.2 overs to prop the lower order. But another collapse followed with Dhoni effecting a second runout to restrict the total.SUMMARISED SCORES
Last week's violent fracas at Delhi's Ramjas College has ignited, yet again, a nationwide debate on freedom of speech and what it means to be (anti) national. The script of the current unrest seems similar to last year's Jawaharlal Nehru University controversy when a group of students was alleged to have raised anti-national slogans. However, JNU student leader Kanhaiya Kumar raised no anti-India slogans for which he was charged with sedition last year, top officials investigating the case have revealed to India Today, citing forensic examination of voice samples.  Controversial slogans resonated through the JNU campus in February, 2016, sparking a national debate on freedom of expression and nationalism.Bhim Sen Bassi was commissioner of the Delhi police when several students of the Jawaharlal Nehru University, including Kumar, were charged with sedition for alleged anti-India cries.POLICE YET TO FILE CASEBut an India Today investigation has found police have yet to file a formal chargesheet in the case that involved charges as serious as sedition. Bassi and his successor Alok Verma have, in the meantime, moved on from the city's police force.A senior special-cell officer, requesting anonymity, said, "We are trying to connect the lose ends and are in the process of filing a chargesheet." The officer added that it would be incorrect to say there is no evidence against accused in the case.Top sources in the Delhi police's special cell, which is investigating the matter, have revealed they sent as many as 40 video samples of the controversial JNU event for forensic examinationMost of the footage, they said, have been found to be authentic.Also read: If Afzal Guru is terrorist, so is Godse: Kanhaiya KumarUMAR KHALID MAY HAVE RAISED ANTI-INDIA CRIESAnti-India sloganeering did ring through the JNU campus that day, but Kumar's voice has tested negative in the forensic tests, highly-placed special-cell sources revealed.Kumar, the investigators said, had reached the scene after a clash broke out between JNU students and Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad activists.But lab examinations have identified nine students as possible slogan-shouters, including Umar Khalid and Anirban Bhattacharya, special-cell sources said.Most of the other slogan shouters were Kashmiri students from several universities, Jamia Millia Islamia and the Aligarh Muslim University included, according to special-cell officials.But no FIR has since been lodged against the Kashmiri suspects, they said.Also read: Ramjas violence: Campus politics turning colleges into battlegrounds, hurting academic freedom?KANHAIYA: HAVE ALWAYS MAINTAINED MY INNOCENCEIndia Today spoke to Kanhaiya Kumar, who said he has not seen this report, but added that he has always maintained that he has been wrongly implicated.

He went on to question if those who attacked him when he was brought to court would be booked and also asked if the BJP leaders who spoke against him would apologise. 
In line with previous leaks and rumors, Nokia unveiled a re-incarnated version of their iconic Nokia 3310 feature phone along with a slew of Android powered smartphones during their MWC 2017 event.While the Nokia 3, Nokia 5 and Nokia 6 are the big ticket items aimed at the general public, it was the Nokia 3310 that was undoubtedly the star of the show and grabbed everyone's attention. An oddity, a relic of a bygone era, the Nokia 3310 is a feature phone that dares to stand tall amongst today's infinitely complex smartphones. A new report claims that the Nokia 3310 will be released globally before Nokia's three Android smartphones. The Nokia 3310 will be launching in April, with the Nokia 3, Nokia 6, Nokia 5 and Nokia 3 getting a staggered release throughout May. A feature phone in 2017 might seem like a ludicrous idea to some. But when you think about it, the mind-blowing battery life, tank like build quality and the affordable price point makes a feature phone such as the Nokia 3310 an excellent option for a secondary phone and even as a primary device for those who are sick of the ultra connected world we live in.Also Read:  Sony Xperia XZ Premium is the world's first smartphone with a 4K HDR displayThe original Nokia 3310 was a legend. There are instance of people still using the Nokia 3310 17 years after they bought it in the year 2000 without any problem. Can you imagine a smartphone of toady's time lasting even remotely close to that long?Thus, it is pretty clear that the re-incarnation of the Nokia 3310 has a lot to live up-to. Does it carry forward the legacy of its predecessor? What all has changed? Let's find out! Also Read:  New Nokia 3310 launch is not about phone, it's about sending a message
New Delhi, Feb 28 (PTI) MPs and MLAs should be recalled within two years from being elected if 75 per cent of those who voted for them are not satisfied with their performance, according to a bill moved by BJP MP Varun Gandhi. "Logic and justice necessitate that if the people have the power to elect their representatives, they should also have the power to remove these representatives when they engage in misdeeds or fail to fulfil the duties," Varun said. Stating that the countries all over the world have experimented with the concept of Right to Recall, the Lok Sabha MP has proposed an amendment in the Representation of the People Act 1951 through his Representation of the People (Amendment) Bill, 2016. As per the legislation, recalling process can be initiated by any voter of the constituency by filing a petition before the Speaker, signed by at least one-fourth of the total number of electors in that constituency. After confirming its authenticity, the Speaker will move the application to the Election Commission for its verification and authentication of the voters signatures on it. The Commission will verify the signatures on it and will organise the voting on 10 places in the respective constituency of MP or MLA, it says. If three-fourth of the votes that member was polled in his election, go in favour of the recall process, the member will be recalled, the bill proposes. Within 24 hours of the receipt of the result, the Speaker will notify the result to the general public. Once the seat gets duly vacated the Commission can organise a bypoll in that constituency. "A free and fair election is the right of the citizens of the country and in the event of their elected representatives no longer enjoying their confidence, the people must have a right to remove them," Varun said. 
Former India captain Sourav Ganguly said Virat Kohli will come back strongly in the second Test against Australia in Bangalore after a rare failure in Pune.CLICK TO WATCH FULL VIDEOKohli, who has had a record-breaking home season, became the first batsman in history to slam four double hundreds in successive series. However, Kohli fell for a second-ball duck in the first innings, chasing a wide one off Mitchell Starc and then shouldered arms to a straight ball from Steve O'Keefe in the second to record scores of 0 and 13 respectively. (Never challenge Virat Kohli, he will come good in Bengaluru: Harbhajan Singh to India Today)These were Kohli's worst returns at home in a Test where he has batted in both innings, it was his first duck at home and only fifth overall. A couple of off days for the captain meant a staggering 333-run defeat for India. Last week, not even the most ardent Australian fan would have thought that was possible.

A female engineer at Tesla has accused Elon Musk?s car company of ignoring her complaints of ?pervasive harassment?, paying her a lower salary than men doing the same work, promoting less qualified men over her and retaliating against her for raising concerns.The allegations of AJ Vandermeyden, who still works at the celebrated electric car manufacturer, paint a picture of a hostile work environment dominated by men where inappropriate sexual behavior is tolerated and women face numerous barriers to advance their careers.Vandermeyden, 33, shared her story with the Guardian at a time when Silicon Valley is reeling from the explosive allegations of former Uber engineer Susan Fowler. In a viral blogpost, she alleged that management and HR dismissed her complaints about documented sexual harassment and sexism, protected a repeat offender because he was a ?high performer? and suggested that women in the company were not as skilled as men.Offering a rare public account of discrimination from a tech worker who remains employed at her company, Vandermeyden said her dedication to Tesla motivated her to advocate for fair treatment and reforms ? despite the serious risks she knows she faces for going public. ?Until somebody stands up, nothing is going to change,? she said in a recent interview, her first comments about a discrimination lawsuit she filed last year. ?I?m an advocate of Tesla. I really do believe they are doing great things. That said, I can?t turn a blind eye if there?s something fundamentally wrong going on.? Vandermeyden began at Tesla in 2013 and was eventually promoted to a manufacturing engineering position in the general assembly department, which consisted mostly of men and where she was paid less than male engineers whose work she directly took over, according to her complaint. It?s shocking in this day and age that this is still a fight we have to haveIt was common for her to be the only woman in meetings with 40 to 50 men, she said on a recent morning, seated in the living room of her family?s house in San Carlos, the city where Tesla was founded, located across the bay from its current factory in Fremont.Currently, all chief executive positions are held by men at Tesla, and out of more than 30 vice-presidents, only two are women, she added. ?It?s shocking in this day and age that this is still a fight we have to have.?Vandermeyden said that when complaints arise at Tesla about workplace issues or inequality, the response is often: ??We?re focused on making cars. We don?t have time to deal with all this other stuff.??Tesla, founded in 2003, has gained international recognition for its battery-powered vehicles and ?autonomous? driving technology, promoted by Musk, the ambitious entrepreneur who makes headlines for bold pledges about space travel, artificial intelligence, underground tunnels and driverless cars.But Vandermeyden?s complaint, filed last fall, alleges that there were inadequacies in the quality testing of cars, and that she raised issues about the flaws she observed, which supervisors and male engineers had missed. Although she came up with a solution, men were granted positions above her, her lawyers wrote. She and other female engineers were denied promotions even though they were ?equally or more qualified? than the men, according to the complaint. At the same time, she also experienced ?unwelcome and pervasive harassment by men on the factory floor including but not limited to inappropriate language, whistling, and catcalls?, the lawsuit said. Vandermeyden recounted to the Guardian an incident in 2015 when she said a group of roughly 20 men standing on a platform above her and a female colleague began taunting as they walked past. ?They all started hooting and hollering and whistling,? she said. ?That can?t happen without somebody noticing ? It?s disturbing.? But her objections about sexual harassment and unequal pay only caused her more trouble, according to her complaint. The lawsuit alleges that after she raised concerns in the fall of 2015, management told her that in order to advance her position, she needed to achieve a performance standard in the factory that was unattainable and not expected of male engineers. Despite positive performance evaluations, she felt she had to transfer out of general assembly to the purchasing department where she continues to work today, according to her suit. The lawsuit said Tesla also denied her overtime pay, rest breaks and meal periods when she worked in sales, and retaliated against her for being a ?whistleblower? when she raised concerns about cars ?sold in a defective state?.Some of her claims of mistreatment echo those that have recently emerged from Tesla factory workers, who allege that they have to work long hours for low wages in unsafe conditions. Musk has vigorously denied those claims and criticized an effort by workers to unionize. Tesla initially declined to respond to the Guardian?s questions about Vandermeyden?s claims, but after publication of this report, released a statement on Tuesday defending its actions and refuting her allegations. A spokesperson said that Tesla had hired a ?neutral third party? last year to investigate her accusations and that an ?exhaustive review of the facts? concluded her ?claims of gender discrimination, harassment, and retaliation have not been substantiated?.The company added in its statement: ?Tesla is committed to creating a positive workplace environment that is free of discrimination for all our employees.?Therese Lawless, Vandermeyden?s lawyer, criticized the investigation, saying, ?We did not believe that it was a comprehensive report ... We vehemently disagree with their finding.?Vandermeyden?s suit said she has suffered ?mental distress? and ?humiliation?.In an interview, she said it takes a toll on her knowing that her work is undervalued. ?Equal pay is something that is essentially in the back of your mind every single day,? she said. ?You have all these data points showing how you?ve exceeded some of the predecessors and improved on the system. It wears on you.? It?s very difficult for women to come forward. They?re concerned that their career is going to be jeopardizedMany women in similar positions choose not to speak up, Lawless said. ?It?s very difficult for women to come forward. They?re concerned that their career is going to be hindered or jeopardized.? For those who do raise complaints, dealing with HR can be a painful struggle, added Lawless, who represented former Reddit CEO Ellen Pao in her high-profile discrimination lawsuit against venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers.?Most of my clients come in and say, ?human resources isn?t helping me. They?re just protecting the company.?? Vandermeyden recently took out a hefty loan to buy the cheapest version of the Model S Tesla car and has a reservation for the upcoming Model 3. She is hopeful her lawsuit and public comments won?t end her career at a company she loves: ?I think they?re a revolutionary and innovative company.?But she admitted she has doubts about her future. ?Half the time when I walk into work, I wonder if my badge is going to work.?

Union minister Kiren Rijiju has accused Left parties of misleading people amid the raging controversy over Delhi University student Gurmehar Kaur's social media posts . Kaur, daughter of Captain Mandeep Singh who was martyred in a terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir in 1999, is at the centre of a huge row which erupted after her posts on social media against the violence which took place at DU's Ramjas College last week."She(Gurmehar Kaur) is a young girl, creating controversy over her isn't right. It is about leftists who celebrate when our jawans die," Rijiju said. "During war between India and China they (left) supported China; they mislead the youth and it is not right,"?the Minister of State for Home Affairs added. "She is a martyr's daughter. His soul must be weeping that his daughter is being misguided by those who celebrate on the bodies of martyrs," Rijiju said.Rijiju's remarks were in response to Kaur's video in which she is seen holding a placard which read," Pakistan didn't kill my father, war did." Kaur had actually posted the video in May last year advocating India-Pakistan peace and it was reposted after February 22 violence in Ramjas College as part of protest against BJP-backed Akhil Bhartiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP). The student organisation was blamed behind the violence in which students, teachers and journalists were beaten up. PROTEST MARCH AT RAMJASMeanwhile, hundreds of students and teachers of Delhi University, JNU and Jamia hit the streets with a call to "save" the varsities from the "onslaught" of ABVP and "curbing" of dissent. However, Gurmehar Kaur opted out of the protest march. Her mother said she has left Delhi. The students held posters with messages like "Your nationalism is not above our democracy".The protesters, mainly comprising students of left forums like AISA, shouted slogans "ABVP Go Back" and "Azaadi" as the march made its way through the roads of North Campus towards the Arts Faculty building.The gates of the colleges falling on the route of the march, which began from the gates of Khalsa College, were shut."We are marching to reclaim the space to debate and discuss. It is about the freedom to coexist, yet disagree," a student said.There was heavy police deployment to prevent a rerun of the clashes that were witnessed between ABVP and AISA last week following cancellation of an event at Ramjas College after activists of the RSS-backed students' wing objected to the invitation to JNU student leaders Umar Khalid and Shehla Rashid.(With inputs from PTI)WATCH: DU protest: As students march against Ramjas violence, ABVP turns defensiveALSO READ:

While 10 super cars were seized from near Akkarai on East Coast Road on Sunday evening for violating traffic, deeper investigations have revealed the story of a traffic policeman who defied norms and stood against the VIP culture. Following the incident, an FIR was filed against 10 persons. The accused were also booked for rash driving, obstructing public servant and hindering him from conducting his duty. "Apparently, a traffic unit detected the 10 Supercars grouping near VGP, ECR for a rally and informed the control room. Another team detected the speed of the vehicle near Akkarai which exceeded 180km/hr on a stretch that was 60km/hr zone", explained a police officer. "What's bad is that they didn't even stop when we intercepted them at Akkarai", he added. Traffic Inspector Soundarrajan and his team were alerted near the Uthama toll gate as the cars sped away from Akkarai. Soundarrajan, blocked the cars and cordoned them. When he asked for the documentation, the drivers were able to only give them a copy of their driver's license and refused to cooperate.TRAFFIC COP INJUREDThe situation turned ugly when a Lamborghini Aventador tried to break from line and escape. Soundarrajan jumped in front of the car to stop it. But the driver ran over Soundarrajan's foot and escaped. The driver was later identified as Raghav Krishna by the cops and an additional FIR under section 332 IPC was filed against him. Kanathur Police later tracked Raghav's residence in the night and apprehended the vehicle. All 10 drivers were left on station bail. "We initiated the traffic check after the countless complaints from people. I have done my job and law and order will take it from here," said Sounderrajan. But unofficial account stated that there was too much pressure from above who wanted Kanathur Police to release the seized vehicles at once due to their whopping Rs 50 Cr cost. Yet, Soundarrajan, Kanathur police and Neelangarai Assistant Commissioner S Pandian, decided to go ahead with the impounding as for the public safety was more important than costly cars.

Bhopal, Feb 27 (PTI) As many as 287 farmers, including agriculture labourers have committed suicide in Madhya Pradesh during the past three months. This information was revealed by the state government in a written reply to a question asked by senior Congress MLA Ram Niwas Rawat. The data provided by the state government in reply to Rawats question in the Assembly today revealed 106 farmers and 181 agricultural labourers have committed suicide during a period of about three months from November 16, 2016 to February (upto the date of question) this year. Rawat had asked how many persons have committed suicide in the state during this period. While replying to Rawats question during the winter session in December last year, the state government had said that 531 farmers/farm labourers had committed suicide between July 1 and November 15, 2016. 
Maharashtra's bar dancers have waltzed up to the Supreme Court and argued that the prevailing ban-like atmosphere in the state could push them into activities like prostitution.Members of the Bharatiya Bar Girls Union knocked on the SC's door on Monday against the "unjust and arbitrary" new restrictions such as curbs on body movement, ban on acceptance of tips and showering of money as well as serving of liquor in performing area apart from mandatory installation of CCTV cameras.They reminded the court that the closing down of the bars in 2005 left over 75,000 female workers unemployed. They brought to the apex court's attention the observation of another bench that struck down a similar state law. The plea will be heard on March 2. The Maharashtra government had over a decade ago suspended the licences of bars and hotels where young women were employed to dance to racy film songs for male customers, claiming they were a bad influence on society.But the top court said last year that bars could once again apply for licences.SUPREME COURT'S JUDGMENTThe SC had in an earlier judgment said, "It has been brought on the record that many of them (bar dancers) have been compelled to take up prostitution out of necessity for maintenance of their families. In our opinion, the impugned legislation has proved to be totally counterproductive and cannot be sustained."This is the first time that bar dancers themselves have come forward to oppose the Maharashtra law.Till now the challenge was only from hotel, restaurant and dance bar owners. The fresh plea has termed the new Act as "arbitrary" and "violative" of their right to earn a livelihood through legitimate means. The union alleges that the term "obscene dance" in the Act has been deliberately kept vague to allow police to harass performers.The SC had earlier slammed the Maharashtra Police on the matter. The apex court summoned and reminded the Mumbai DCP (licensing) that it was better for women to perform in dance bars than indulge in "unacceptable activities"."You have to change your mindset," Justice Dipak Misra had said. "Regulation is different from prohibition."ALSO READ: India Today impact: Thane municipality razes 27 illegal dance bars to the ground

The Indian Air Force will in the next few weeks finish weaving a security web with the Israeli SPYDER air defence missile system on the western borders in a bid to strengthen its preparedness to strike down any aerial threat from Pakistan.The induction process was delayed by over three years due to the nonavailability of Czech-made Tatra trucks on which the missiles were to be carried."The SPYDER missile system is already in the process of deployment along the western borders where it will help in tackling any aircraft, cruise missile, surveillance plane or drone that tries to violate our airspace," senior defence sources told MAIL TODAY.WHAT IS SPYDER?The SPYDER (Surface-to-air PYthon and DERby) is a low-level, quick reaction missile (LLQRM) to neutralise hostile targets up to 15 km away and at heights between 20 and 9,000 metres. The Python-5 is currently the most capable air-to-air missile (AAM) in Israel's inventory, while the Derby is an active radar homing AAM that provides the SPYDER missile system with a fireand-forget option."The IAF will use the SPYDER along with the made-in-India Akash surface-to-air missile which has a little longer effective range of 25 km as part of a layered approach to defend vital assets and locations in the country," the sources stated.DEAL MADE IN 2008The SPYDER deal was completed by the IAF with Rafael and Israeli Aircraft Industries (IAI) in 2008 and supplies were to begin in three to four years. But the process got delayed due to the unavailability of the Tatra trucks, which got mired in a controversy over bribery allegations."Due to the lack of heavy specialised trucks, changes had to be made in the contract with the vendors and a made-in-India truck has been used for carrying the SPYDER system, which has been tested extensively resulting in delays," the sources said.Both the SPYDER and Akash are all-weather missiles and the process to seek and engage an aggressive aircraft or missile is automatic. Besides aircraft and UAVs, they can also neutralise lowlevel cruise missiles.The IAF has taken a slew of measures to strengthen its air defence capabilities in the recent past as it is also going to deploy another air defence system called the Medium Range Surface to Air Missile (MRSAM) system from Israel, which can strike down targets at 50-70km.The force would receive a major boost when it starts getting the S-400 air defence missile system from Russia, which can take out targets at 400 km and can be very effective against enemy AWACS (Airborne Warning And Control System) and cruise missiles at great distances.ALSO READ:?

The president of Poland?s supreme court has urged the country?s judges to ?fight for every inch of justice? as the rightwing government pushes for changes that critics say would make judicial independence a ?pure fiction?.?For over a year I have been repeating that the courts are easily turned into a plaything in the hands of politicians,? Ma?gorzata Gersdorf told her colleagues in an open letter read out at a recent gathering of judges in Warsaw. ?What was until now a threat is becoming a reality.?In its latest battle with Poland?s legal system, the ruling Law and Justice party (PiS) says it wants to ?democratise? the way Polish judges are appointed, which at the moment is a job for the National Council of the Judiciary (KRS), an autonomous body whose judicial members are chosen by their peers.Under the government?s proposals, however, the terms of all the judicial members of the council would be terminated within 90 days of the draft law?s enactment. Their replacements would be selected by the Polish parliament, with the speaker of the parliament given discretion as to which candidates should be put forward for consideration.Whereas the council?s judicial members presently enjoy a majority, under the government?s proposals the body would be split into two chambers, one for judicial members and the other for political representatives. Both chambers would have to agree to an appointment or a resolution, giving the political representatives a veto over decisions made by the judicial members.?The government?s proposals will be an instrument for ensuring the appointment of the ?right? kind of judges who will not be too critical of the authorities and their political programme,? said Ewa ??towska, a professor at Poland?s Institute of Legal Sciences and a former judge who served on the country?s constitutional tribunal and the supreme administrative court.The council was given less than three working days to respond to the draft act, receiving it from the Ministry of Justice on a Thursday and expected to provide its official response by the following Tuesday. In a strongly worded statement, it described the proposals as ?in obvious and gross contradiction with the Polish constitution?.?The council is an independent constitutional organ that was instituted in 1989 in order to safeguard the independence of the judiciary, because in the communist era everything was dependent on the ruling party,? Dariusz Zawistowski, chairman of the KRS and a serving supreme court judge, told the Guardian.?When members of the council are elected by the parliament, this function of safeguarding the constitution will be pure fiction. Formally speaking, there would be no independent judiciary.?Gersdorf has urged her fellow judges to risk their own positions in the fight against the proposals.?There is no fight without victims, and among them may be counted some of us present here,? said Gersdorf?s letter to her fellow judges. ?To win, you must be prepared even for disciplinary tribunals, to be removed from office, for anything. You must show that we are in opposition to the pushing of a democratic state into oblivion.?The government describes the proposals as ?enhancing democracy and independence? by freeing the appointments process from ?the corporate interests of the judicial environment?, citing the judicial appointments process in countries such as Spain and Germany.?Objectivity in selecting members of the National Council of the Judiciary and their independence from corporate interests is to be ensured by them being selected by the Sejm, which holds a mandate gained in democratic elections. A similar system is successful for instance in Spain,? said the Ministry of Justice in a statement.But the KRS?s response rejects such comparisons. ?It must be recalled that in accordance with article 8(1) of the constitution, it is the constitution of the Republic of Poland of 2 April 1997 that is the supreme law in the Republic of Poland, and not the constitution of Spain of 31 October 1978 or the basic law of the Federal Republic of Germany of 23 May 1949.?The controversy is the latest front in a protracted battle between the PiS and an increasingly demoralised judiciary.Shortly after assuming power in late 2015, the government merged the office of prosecutor general with that of the justice minister, Zbigniew Ziobro, a move that some analysts argue has already allowed the government to exert political pressure on judges.?We have already seen numerous examples of prosecutors answerable to the minister of justice initiating criminal proceedings against judges who have reached decisions they don?t agree with,? said ??towska.
Hot on the heels of Nokia, LG and Huawei's, Sony has unveiled their latest Xperia flagship Smartphone - the Xperia XZ Premium at the Mobile World Conference in Barcelona. The Xperia XZ Premium is undoubtedly the company's most exciting device in years and comes with a range of breakthrough features, the chief amongst them being the world's first 4K HDR display in a smartphone. Unlike the LG G6, which has eschewed Qualcomm's latest processor - the Snapdragon 835 in favour of the older Snapdragon 821 in order to gain the first mover advantage over the Galaxy S8, Sony has decided to stick with the 835 for the XZ Premium.The catch here is the fact that the XZ Premium will not be out before Spring, which is quite some time away. Additionally, the smartphone comes with 4GB of RAM, a 3,230mAh battery with QuickCharge 3.0 support and Android 7.0 out of the box. As with previous Xperia's, the power button doubles up as a fingerprint scanner. Also Read:  Nokia 3310 relaunched: What is its price and other questions answeredTouted as a 'game-changing camera', the Sony Xperia XZ Premium comes with an entirely new camera system called the 'Motion Eye' which comes with the world's first memory stacked sensor. Sony has embedded fast memory right into the camera stack which allows the smartphone to capture video at an astonishing 960 frames per second, which is 4 times slower than any other smartphone available today. Sony claims that the ' World's fastest image capture technology in a smartphone' allows the camera to capture instances that occur in the blink of an eye and reveal things beyond what the human vision is capable of seeing. The added memory also brings with it improved predictive capture in the XZ Premium. The device starts to buffer images the moment it detects motion and selects 4 of the best photos by analysing the speed of the moving object.Additionally, the XZ Premium also comes with the same triple-sensor system found in the Xperia XZ, although the sensor's resolution has been reduced slightly to 19 megapixels. It has an aperture of f/2.0 and comes with SteadyShot and an 'Anti-distortion' shutter. On the front, there is a 13MP camera with an aperture of f/2.0 for selfies.Along with the camera, the display is what sets the XZ Premium apart from the competition. It is the first smartphone in the world to come with a 4K HDR display which is 5.5' in size and is also 40% brighter than the Xperia Z5 Premium's panel.The problem with the Xperia Z5 Premium was the fact that there was little or no 4K content available to enjoy on the smartphone. To remedy this, Sony has entered into a partnership with Amazon Prime Video where users will be able to enjoy a selection of 4K HDR content on their smartphones.Lastly, Sony has entered into a partnership with Qualcomm in order to create a new class of devices that are capable of gigabit LTE speeds. The XZ Premium will be the first smartphone to feature the same and offer not only high speeds but much better speeds everywhere.

Union Minister Uma Bharti on Monday said the BJP made "a huge mistake" by not fielding any Muslim candidate in the ongoing Uttar Pradesh assembly polls."I am really feeling sorry that we could not field a Muslim. I spoke with (BJP President) Amit Shah and (state party President) Keshav Prasad Maurya about how we could have brought a Muslim to the assembly," Uma Bharti told CNN-News18. "Rajnathji has said the right thing, we could have given ticket (to Muslims)," she said, referring to Home Minister and Bharatiya Janata Party leader Rajnath Singh.Uma Bharti's comments met with opposition from her colleague, with Rajya Sabha member Vinay Katiyar questioning the logic behind fielding Muslims. "When Muslims do not vote for us, then why should we give ticket to them," asked Katiyar.

In a scathing attack, DMK's working president MK Stalin alleged that former Tamil Nadu chief minister O Panneerselvam was using former chief minister J Jayalalithaa's name for gaining political mileage. Taking on Panneerselvam for criticising his demand that Jayalalithaa's name be removed from government schemes, Stalin said OPS had never raised doubts about the mystery behind the death of Jayalalithaa when he was chief minister. Stalin's remark demanding removal of Jayalalithaa's photo from government installations and her name from government funded public welfare schemes has stirred a new controversy in the state. Both VK Sasikala and O Panneerselvam camps have taken extreme offense to Stalin's statement.Stalin, still holding his stand claimed that it is illegal and unconstitutional to depict pictures of Jayalalithaa on government funded programs.
Two clubs in the winter sport of bandy raced to put the ball into their own nets 20 times on Sunday and now face disciplinary action.The Russian Super League game in the northern city of Arkhangelsk finished in an 11-9 win for Baikal-Energiya against local club Vodnik. It was 0-0 with 22 minutes to go before Vodnik player Oleg Pivovarov scored three own goals.Baikal-Energiya responded with nine own-goals in quick succession. Not to be outdone, Pivovarov then put the ball into his own team?s goal eight more times in the final seven minutes.Both teams now face ?very tough measures,? Russian Bandy Federation president Boris Skrynnik told the Tass news agency.He accused Vodnik of starting the own-goal extravaganza in order to ?play against a convenient team? in the upcoming playoffs. Had Vodnik won, it would have faced the league?s reigning champion.The result mattered less to Baikal-Energiya, which was already assured of facing a much weaker club in the playoffs. As a result, its players ?decided to have some fun? and score own goals too, Skyrnnik claimed.Not well known outside Russia and Scandinavia, bandy is a relative of ice hockey played on a large outdoor rink with a rubber ball. It?s played at semi-professional level in Russia.Sunday?s game carries echoes of a scandal at the 2012 Olympics in badminton. Eight female players from South Korea, China and Indonesia deliberately made basic errors in the group stage as they tried to manipulate the draw for the next round. All were disqualified from the Olympics.In soccer, a 2002 Madagascan league game reportedly saw the Stade Olympique de l?Emyrne team score a record 149 own-goals as a protest against what they felt was unfair refereeing.

New Delhi, Feb 26 (PTI) Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar will address two rallies in the national capital ahead of the municipal polls, where JD(U) will contest all the 272 seats, taking on the AAP on its home turf. The partys Delhi in-charge Sanjay Jha announced it an event where few district-level Aam Aadmi Party workers, mainly from east Delhi, joined JD(U), accusing the AAP of neglecting Poorvanchalis in MCD ticket distribution. Jha said JD(U) aims to tap the "discontent" among the AAPs poorvanchali voters base. He said the Poorvanchalis here have been "let down" by the Arvind Kejriwal government despite having extended every possible backing to it over the last two years. "Nitish Kumar will address two rallies, one each in north and south Delhi after Holi. The first list of our candidates will be out within a week," he said. BJPs decision to appoint Bhojpuri artiste Manoj Tiwari as its Delhi unit chief is also being seen as an attempt to woo the Poorvanchali community, comprising the people from the eastern part of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. The Delhi unit of JD(U) was constituted during Kumars visit here on December 3 last year. Jha brushed aside Kumars perceived closeness with Kejriwal, saying JD(U) will work for expanding its base and work towards ensuring "fair" representation of the Poorvanchali population. AAP had supported JD(U) in the 2015 Bihar Assembly polls and the two parties often cooperate in Parliament. 
All eyes have been on Deepika Padukone and Priyanka Chopra's outings in the West, ever since they migrated to Hollywood. And when the event in question is the 89th Annual Academy Awards, the anticipation is sky-high. While Deepika had denied that she will be attending the Oscars this year, Priyanka Chopra had confirmed her attendance by posting a selfie with rock legend Mick Jagger.However, Deepika made her presence felt at the Women in Film (WIF) pre-Oscar cocktail party. The actor, who made her Hollywood debut this year with Vin Diesel in xXx: Return Of Xander Cage, looked stunning in her asymmetrical black dress, leading to speculation that she will make her Oscar debut this year, after all.Meanwhile, Priyanka was snapped having a ball at the WME pre-Oscar party. Pee Cee's Oscar debut last year became a rage and her white gown even earned her a mention in the list of top searched dresses of 2016.
From Lalit K Jha Washington, Feb 22 (PTI) The adoption of the GST could help raise Indias medium-term GDP growth to over eight per cent and create a single national market for enhancing the efficiency of the movement of goods and services, the IMF said today. At the same time, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) also expressed concerns over the implementation of the Goods and Service Tax (GST). "Although some uncertainties remain around the design and pace of implementation of the GST, its adoption is poised to help raise Indias medium-term GDP growth to above 8 per cent as it will create a single national market and enhance the efficiency of intra-Indian movement of goods and services," the IMF said in its annual country report on India. The IMF said larger than expected gains from the GST and further structural reforms could lead to significantly stronger growth, while a sustained period of continued low global energy prices would also be beneficial to India. Noting that Indias tax revenue-to-GDP ratio (at around 17 and a half per cent) remains considerably below than its emerging market peers, the IMF said the implementation of a robust GST should be a key priority given its growth-enhancing effects. "The GST should have minimal exemptions, uniform cross-state rates, and as few tax rate tiers as possible," it said. Key production inputs, such as energy and real estate, should be kept within the tax base to enable greater output gains and reduce the tax burden across sectors, the IMF said. Rationalisation of the structure of direct taxes toward a lower corporate income tax rate with smaller and streamlined deductions and exemptions should continue, it said. Efforts to improve tax administration should be stepped up as the scope for revenue gains is large. According to the IMF report, Indian authorities were confident that the outstanding issues related to GST implementation could be settled promptly. "The GST would provide for a significant improvement over the current indirect tax system. Tax reform priorities going forward include continuing the phased reduction of the corporate income tax rate from 30 to 25 per cent over four years, coupled with a simultaneous reduction in tax deductions," it said. The GST replaces a plethora of cascading center, state, interstate and local taxes with a single, nationwide, value-added tax on goods and services. 
Amid the controversy over an Army jawan describing the menial duties a sahayak is entrusted with by the Army officers and their families, comes the tale of a senior Army officer flying all the way from Canada to attend a wedding in his sahayak's family.For Colonel GS Ghuman, all it took was a call from his former 'buddy' - as sahayaks are known in the Army - inviting him to attend his son's wedding.Havildar Balagowda Raigowda Patil worked as the Colonel's buddy for almost two decades, before the two retired from the Army around 10 years ago."He (Patil) is family. How could I say no. I had to attend his son's wedding. So here I am, in India," Col Ghuman told PTI.The feeling was reciprocated by Patil, who said, "Saab's (Col Ghuman) mother treated me like her fourth son. Saab also never treated me as a junior but like a brother.""I was with saab since the IPKF days in Sri Lanka. I never felt humiliated as a 'buddy'," Patil, who retired in 2006, said.Col Ghuman retired the next year. Both were in the 25 Madras Regiment, where Patil's son, who got married recently, is posted as an Army jawan.The wedding took place at Patil's native place, around 50 kms from Belgaum.Col Ghuman also used this trip to reconnect with former jawans in his unit, and travelled to places like Mangalore, Kochi and Hyderabad to meet them and their families, before flying back to Canada.Col Ghuman's gesture comes amid reports that the Army is contemplating withdrawing combat soldiers working as sahayaks from peace stations across the country and post them back to their field formations.
London/New Delhi, Feb 26 (PTI) Global banking giant HSBC has disclosed being probed by tax authorities in India and several other countries, including against its Swiss and Dubai units, for allegedly abetting tax evasion of four Indians and their families. Besides, the bank has been approached by the regulatory and law enforcement agencies of various countries for information on persons and entities named in the leaked Panama Papers -- which included hundreds of Indians who had indulged in alleged tax violations through offshore tax havens with the help of Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca. Disclosing the "tax-related investigations" in its latest annual report published last week, HSBC further said it has set aside USD 773 million (over Rs 5,000 crore) as a provision for various tax- and money laundering-related matters. "There are many factors that may affect the range of outcomes, and the resulting financial impact of these investigations and reviews. Due to uncertainties and limitations of these estimates, the ultimate penalties could differ significantly from the amount provided," HSBC said, while adding that it is cooperating with the relevant authorities. "Various tax administrations, regulatory and law enforcement authorities around the world, including in the US, France, Belgium, Argentina and India, are conducting investigations and reviews of HSBC Swiss Private Bank and other HSBC companies in connection with allegations of tax evasion or tax fraud, money laundering and unlawful cross- border banking solicitation," it said. Giving case-wise details, it further said the Indian tax authorities in February 2015 had issued a summons and request for information to an HSBC company in India. "In August 2015 and November 2015, HSBC companies received notices issued by two offices of the Indian tax authority alleging that the Indian tax authority had sufficient evidence to initiate prosecution against HSBC Swiss Private Bank and an HSBC company in Dubai for allegedly abetting tax evasion of four different Indian individuals and/or families and requesting that the HSBC companies show why such prosecution should not be initiated. "HSBC Swiss Private Bank and the HSBC company in Dubai have responded to the show-cause notices," it said, but did not disclose the name of the Indian individuals. 
Barcelona, Feb 26 (PTI) The fresh round of consolidation unfolding in the Indian telecom market is likely to yield five major players ensuring "enough competition but not fragmentation of spectrum", Telecom Secretary J S Deepak said. His comments assume significance as India -- the worlds second largest mobile services market after China -- is in the midst of massive consolidation with incumbent operators joining forces to take on aggressive newcomer Reliance Jio. The consolidation in the otherwise crowded Indian telecom industry has been hastened by Jios free voice call and data plans, forcing incumbents to slash tariff at the cost of profits. "Dropping revenue is a concern which we are also addressing...Era of free service and falling revenue will change...In this backdrop, the investments in India are not only welcome but are also likely to be productive," Deepak told PTI. On consolidation playing out in the telecom market, he said, "The way things are...this consolidation is going to be very good for India as we are likely to get four private and one government player...BSNL-MTNL...which is ideal." Asked if the spate of buyouts would leave enough room for competition in the Indian market, Deepak said, "Ideal is five players for India, which is what is likely to happen". Stating that the consolidation is potentially resulting in five big players would ensure "enough competition but not fragmentation of spectrum", he said, it will be "optimum for the Indian market". Last week, Indias largest telecom operator Bharti Airtel announced acquisition of Norwegian Telenors India unit. Bharti Airtels revenue market share will rise to 35.6 per cent following the acquisition. Telenor India currently has 2.6 per cent share in Indian market. Vodafone and Idea have already said that they are considering merging their businesses in India, a move that would create the biggest telecom operator in the country with about USD 12 billion in sales. 
Multiple world champion Manny Pacquiao has agreed to fight Britain?s Olympic silver medallist Amir Khan on 23 April, with both boxers on Sunday confirming their intentions to appear in a ?super fight?. The 38-year-old Pacquiao had said four days ago that he and Khan?s management were in discussions for the fight, despite an earlier announcement the Filipino?s next bout would be against Jeff Horn. Pacquiao, however, had said that Horn was one of many possible opponents. The Australian welterweight?s dream fight was slated for the same date in April with Brisbane a likely host, but the school teacher?s hopes have now been extinguished.?Negotiations between team Pacquiao and team Khan have come to terms for the April 23 bout as this is what the fans wanted,? Pacquiao tweeted. The 30-year-old Khan, who won silver as a lightweight at the Athens Olympics, has not fought since last May when he moved up two weight classes to fight middleweight Canelo Álvarez.The much bigger Mexican proved too powerful and the Briton was knocked out in the sixth round and he is likely to drop back to welterweight to fight Pacquiao, who holds the World Boxing Organisation title at the weight. ?My team and I have agreed terms with Manny Pacquiao and his team for a super fight,? Khan said on his Twitter page. Pacquiao won the WBO welterweight title last November against American Jessie Vargas in Las Vegas with an unanimous decision.A Horn-Pacquiao fight would have been one of the biggest in Australian boxing history, with the Queensland government backing the push for Suncorp Stadium to host.Horn had released a video on Sunday, cut with excerpts from Donald Trump speeches, calling on Pacquiao to make a fight happen in Brisbane, where he claimed the money on offer was ?real? and already in place. No venue for Pacquiao?s clash with Khan, a former sparring partner, has been announced.

Former Australia captain Michael Clarke was surprised with the way Steve Smith's men hammered India on a tailor-made pitch for the hosts in the first Test in Pune.Steve O'Keefe picked up match figures of 12/70 as Australia decimated India by 333 runs to end their unbeaten streak. (Also read: India suffer first three-day Test defeat since April 2008)CLICK HERE TO WATCH VIDEOSmith scored his fifth successive hundred against India while Mitchell Starc and Nathan Lyon made significant contributions through the course of the match. (Also read: Steve Smith ecstatic after Australia's first Test win in India after 4502 days)"Not too many Australians expected a win like this. Surprised with the way Australia won. Virat Kohli spoke really well after the defeat. He was open and honest. India will look to improve in the next Test," Clarke told India Today. (Also read: Virat Kohli furious after 'worst batting performance in the last two years')"Winning the toss was crucial. Starc's 61 runs were crucial in the first innings and nothing can take away the performance of Steve O'Keefe and his 12 wickets. We can expect a fantastic series now," he added.India, who had not lost a home Test in 20 matches since a 2012 defeat to England in Kolkata, were once again unable to cope with O'Keefe's probing lines after they were bundled out for a paltry 105 in the first innings. Chasing a massive victory target of 441, India scored just two more runs in their second innings to capitulate inside three days at the Maharashtra Cricket Association Stadium, making its debut as a Test centre.O'Keefe's spin colleague Nathan Lyon provided able support, picking up the other four wickets in India's innings for 53 runs."Australia selectors deserve a lot of credit. To their credit they stuck with what was right and it all worked. Don't forget the contributions from Nathan Lyon. The wicket was extremely dry and it looked like it would turn from day one," Clarke said.Clarke also criticised India's sloppy fielding in the match.Smith, who was unbeaten on 59 overnight, was dropped three times on Friday and was handed another lifeline on 67 but maintained his concentration on a tricky surface to bring up his 18th Test hundred.He also enjoyed another slice of fortune on 73 when a strong appeal for leg before off Jadeja was turned down by the umpire with replays indicating the decision would have been overturned on review had India not already used up their two referrals.

Director Kabir Khan lashed out at the Central Board of Film Certification and its chairperson Pahlaj Nihalani over the CBFC's denial of a certificate for Alankrita Srivastava's film, Lipstick Under My Burkha. Ironically, the film has won several awards internationally, including laurels for gender equality. The film was also widely celebrated at the Tokyo Film Festival and MAMI (Mumbai Film Festival) last year.Speaking exclusively to India Today, Kabir Khan said that his first reaction to the news was, "Oh god, not again! It is becoming a bit of a joke." The man behind blockbusters like Ek Tha Tiger and Bajrangi Bhaijaan said that every two months, the CBFC had made it a habit to do something completely stupid like this.Kabir, whose next Bollywood outing will be Salman Khan-starrer Tubelight, added that the time had come for the film industry to unite and protest for their rights. He took on Pankaj Nihalani and called him an adamant man, saying that it was incorrect for Nihalani or a group of people to dictate what people must see and what they shouldn't.Infact, the director even mocked Nihalani for deciding the duration of James Bond's onscreen kiss on screen. Kabir is of the view that even if the film is not celebrated or directed by a newcomer, it has the right to release. One can always communicate proposed cuts with filmmakers, however a blanket ban on the film's release was absolutely unacceptable and a threat to our freedom of expression.The CBFC's refusal to issue a certificate to Lipstick Under My Burkha, starring Konkona Sen Sharma, Ratna Pathak Shah, Aahana Kumra and Plabita Borthakur, was because "the story is lady oriented, their fantasy above life."Actor Tisca Chopra also slammed the CBFC's decision. An outraged Tisca told India Today, "We have become a laughing stock around the world with this piece of news. I am appalled. This is unacceptable. The reason given for denying the certificate is absolutely absurd. What century are we living in?"Meanwhile, MP Milind Deora tweeted, "#PahlajNihalani certainly isn't aiding the government's cause of "Minimum Government, Maximum Governance". Certify #CBFC, don't censor."#PahlajNihalani certainly isn't aiding the government's cause of "Minimum Government, Maximum Governance".

Joining in the slanging match over the "donkey" barb targeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Congress leader Digvijay Singh today said he "indeed worked like a donkey"."Modi ji, you very rightly said that you indeed work like a donkey," he tweeted.His dig at the Prime Minister came a day after Modi said he takes inspiration from the "loyal" and "hard working" animal and was amused that UP Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav was "afraid" of Gujarat's donkeys.Modi said the criticism of donkeys by Akhilesh only reflected his "casteist mentality" and "the feeling of hatred does not suit him"."In elections, opponents criticise each other Akhileshji I can understand if you attack Modi and BJP but I am amused that you have attacked donkeys are you afraid of donkeys, that too these are thousands of kilometres away?"

A day after the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) polls threw up a hung verdict, Shiv Sena's tally of corporators rose to 87 today with three party rebels who won as Independent nominees returning to its fold. This gave a slight push to Uddhav Thackeray's efforts to cobble up numbers but reaching the magic figure of 114 seats needed to rule the cash-rich civic body is still a far cry. The development came at a time when both the Sena and its estranged ally BJP which has won 82 seats, are keeping cards close to their chest on the prospects of coming together again to attain power or otherwise. While Snehal More (Vikhroli) and Tulsiram Shinde (Dindoshi) arrived at Matoshree, the Bandra residence of Thackeray, in morning where they were reinducted, Changez Multani (Andheri) extended his support in evening. SENA EYEING ANOTHER TERMThe Sena, which has been in power in the BMC for last 20 years with the BJP being a junior partner, is looking forward for another term. It contested the BMC polls separately by dumping the BJP. Sena is a junior partner of the BJP in Centre and Maharashtra government. However, the resurgent BJP breached the Sena citadel of Mumbai and bagged 82 seats, just two less than Sena's Friday tally of 84. It remains unclear whether the saffron siblings will join the hands again or new combinations will emerge to secure 114 seats. BJP spokesperson Madhav Bhandari on Friday said the final decision pertaining to the BMC will be taken by core committee of the party, which is meeting here in the evening. WORKING ON NUMBERS FOR MAYORAL ELECTIONWith the fractured verdict restricting their options, Sena and BJP are trying hard to enlist support of as many corporators as possible to stack up numbers ahead of the Mayoral election scheduled next month. Meanwhile, Thackeray reiterated that Sena will install the next Mayor and said he has not yet thought about alliance. According to sources in the Sena, Thackeray will hold a meeting of all senior party leaders and newly-elected corporators at the Shiv Sena Bhavan to decide on the future course of action. BJP'S CLAIMMeanwhile, a BJP leader has claimed three Independent corporators are willing to give support to BJP in the coming days. The BJP's core committee meeting is currently underway in the city to decide its future strategy. In the counting of votes held on Thursday, Sena won 84 seats, BJP 82, Congress 31, NCP 9, MNS 7, AIMIM 3, Samajwadi Party 6, Akhil Bhartiya Sena 1 and Independents 4.

It was disappointing," former India captain and leg-spinner Kumble told reporters. (Also read: Steve O'Keefe wary of strong India batting line-up despite 6/35)"We were in a pretty decent position when Rahul and Ajinkya (Rahane) were batting out there.

(Also read: Virat Kohli out for duck for the first time in Tests in India)Smith remained unbeaten on 59 with the touring side leading by 298 runs.

A day after the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation polls threw up a fractured verdict, senior BJP leader Nitin Gadkari today said there is "no option" for his party and Shiv Sena than joining hands for control of the Mumbai civic body."The situation now is that both parties have no option but to come together again," Gadkari said."The final decision on this issue has to be taken by Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray. Both are mature and I am sure they will take the right decision," he said."I feel leaders of both parties have to take a decision, showing sujh bujh (understanding) and maturity," Gadkari told a Marathi TV channel.He singled out Sena mouthpiece 'Saamana' for its targeting of PM Narendra Modi and BJP president Amit Shah."If there has to be a friendship with us (BJP), then there has to be a check on the writings in Saamana. How will there be friendship when Saamana, on a daily basis, writes insulting things about the PM and our party president?" he said."I feel that had these things been avoided, there would not have been so much bitterness between BJP and Sena," Gadkari said.Shiv Sena should take care that relations between the two parties should not deteriorate because of Saamana, he said.Gadkari's remarks came a day after the BJP scored an emphatic win in the Maharashtra civic polls, emerging as the largest party in eight of the 10 municipal corporations, while finishing a close second to Shiv Sena in BMC elections.The BJP improved its 2012 BMC poll performance by leaps and bounds, winning 82 seats, just two less than Sena. Both the parties are short of the magic figure of 114 needed to control the civic body.

She added, "It's easier to judge a woman on the basis of how much they cover up their skin, but it's hard to accept your own cheap mentality where you can't stop staring at those inappropriate areas which you are asking her to cover!"Really felt a need to share this! ???? thanks to my fan clubs friends and family for always giving me the strength i hope we all can find this strength from within each other and stop suffering ???? #spreadloveA post shared by disha patani (paatni) (@dishapatani) on Feb 21, 2017 at 2:59am PST She added, "Really felt a need to share this!

From Lalit K Jha Washington, Feb 24 (PTI) Indias demonetisation led to huge cash shortages that have "adversely affected" consumption and like a "vacuum cleaner" it sucked in cash and then was slowly replacing the currency, a senior IMF official has said. "Youve heard about so-called helicopter drops of money with unconventional monetary policies, so one way to characterise this demonetisation initiative is as a vacuum cleaner," Paul A Cashin, Assistant Director in the IMFs Asia and Pacific Department, and mission chief of India, told PTI. "Its sucking in cash, withdrawing it from the economy, and then the vacuum cleaner is going in reverse, slowly replacing cash but as I said, at a fairly modest pace. Thats led to a lot of cash shortages that have adversely affected consumption," Cashin said in response to a question as the IMF released its annual country-report on India. Given the shortage of cash in the market, IMF in its report urged the Indian Government to continue to enhance the supply of new banknotes, and if needed consider extending or expanding targeted temporary exemptions, including on use of old banknotes, particularly for rural and remote areas. "While the financial system is expected to weather the currency exchange-induced temporary growth slowdown, the authorities should remain vigilant given the potential further build-up of NPAs and elevated corporate sector vulnerabilities, and ensure prudent support to the economic sectors affected by the currency exchange initiative," the IMF said. IMF said the repercussions from Indias currency exchange initiative will likely persist through the first quarter of 2017. Real GDP growth is projected to slow to 6.6 per cent in FY2016/17 and then rebound to 7.2 per cent in FY2017/18, due to temporary disruptions (primarily to private consumption) caused by cash shortages accompanying the currency exchange initiative.

If some unscrupulous elements in the prosthetic industry have their way, voter fraud could soon go out of hand, literally.A discreet investigation by India Today has unearthed a ring of prosthetic suppliers who, by their own admission on camera, are selling silicone fingers to political parties trying to rig UP elections.Demands for their wares have shot up, they revealed, with leaders ordering them in bulk for their teams to cast multiple votes by masking their fingers bearing the indelible ink-mark with prostheses.Regarded as a badge of democratic privilege, the finger dye prevents voters from re-voting. But India Today's reporters found this conservative anti-fraud measure might itself be under threat now.'PROMINENT U.P. POLITICAL PARTY PLACED ORDERS'Suppliers of prosthetic body parts, which the network's special investigation team probed, reported brisk business because of current elections.Shambhu Kumar Yadav, a consultant at Delhi's Born Life, disclosed a prominent political party of Uttar Pradesh has placed big orders for silicone fingers with his artificial limbs company."The fact is the xxxx has made the largest purchases. I won't lie. This all will also go to the xxxx," he claimed.If he was to be believed, crooks are procuring prosthetic fingers to trick poll officials into allowing them in election booths for multiple voting, possibly in multiple booths.Prosthetic consultants at P&O International Inc operating from Delhi's Vimhans hospital quoted a price of Rs 1.10 lakh for 10 silicone fingers. They were aware the product would be used for possible fraud in elections."When you punch (biometric devices), it's scanned.?You can't, therefore, use it for punching. In voting, they just leave an ink mark. They won't be able to identify by touch," said Namrata of P&O International Inc at Vimhans.Her boss, Dibakar Patra, promised deliveries in four days."You are getting one index finger made in multiples of five for two," said Namrata."You (one person) can cast your vote five times," explained Patra. Distributors of prosthetics like Patra were not only ready to hawk fake fingers to facilitate bogus voting, they also give a thorough demo about how to use them.Shambhu Kumar Yadav of Born Life was upbeat about sales."The truth is we just got orders for 500 fingers from Lucknow. I am telling you the truth," he said. "Keep these products with you and use them. No other party should be approaching you. You do your work and leave (the scene). I'll have the colour (of the fake finger) match (with the skin) as much as 90 percent," added Yadav.He said he received a single order from a political party for 300 pieces.HEAVY DEMAND BECAUSE OF ELECTIONS Agendra Kumar, a senior consultant at Delhi's Ideal Artificial Limb Solution, also spoke about heavy demand because of UP elections."I am now running away. There's so much of demand from the xxxx," he said, naming a political party of Uttar Pradesh.No one has so far been detected wearing fake fingers while voting, he said.Kumar also explained the modus, suggesting a private hospital place order with his company for bulk imports of the prostheses."It will be better to get them imported. There won't be any problem later," he said.Kumar demanded all his payment in cash for the procurement and supplies."You will be required to give us the address of a hospital with import permit. I'll let you know of some other documents which might also be needed," said Kumar.Not just elections, artificial limbs could also be widely misused in various other sectors, such as recruitment drives.Anupriya Chauhan, another consultant at Ideal Artificial Limb Solution, revealed their clients include police and army aspirants."It (fake fingers) won't be identified in voting. There's hardly any scrutiny. People (with defected limbs) wear them in (medical) examination for police and army recruitment drives and clear them. As such, there shouldn't be any issue in voting. Go there, cast it and come back," she said."Licence is not allowed to any applicant for auto-rickshaw driving in Delhi who has two fingers missing. But they wear these artificial fingers and get clearance," Chauhan added.VIMHANS DENIES INVOLVEMENT IN WRONGDOINGAfter India Today broadcast the investigation, Vimhans denied its involvement in the wrongdoing, saying the hospital only extended office space to Patra to serve the patients for prosthetic consultancy. "The hospital has no involvement in whatever claims he has made," Vimhans spokesman Pramod Tripathi told India Today.No one was available for comment at Born Life when India Today reached its office for the company's reaction.Ideal Artificial Limb Solution's Anupriya Chauhan said she was not authorized to speak on-the-record about India Today's probe.The global prosthetic industry has advanced phenomenally over the past 70 years.From wooden limbs, for example, to body-powered, bionic feel-like-real artificial parts, prostheses have come a long way.According to industry experts, amputees have now a wide variety to choose from and customize their prosthetics.
Rangoon is a triangular love story set in the backdrop of World War II. Here is our Rangoon movie review.Rangoon Cast: Kangana Ranaut, Shahid Kapoor, Saif Ali KhanRangoon Direction: Vishal BhardwajRangoon Rating:?(3.5/5)When Rusi Bilmoria (Saif Ali Khan), an ex-film star who has been just a producer since an on-set accident, finds out that his fiance, the love of his life Miss Julia (Kangana Ranaut), also the top star of his company, has cheated on him with a soldier, Jamadar Nawab Malik (Shahid Kapoor), he turns his head silently towards his woman and looks at her with eyes red with grief, shock and the rage of a thousand suns.If you thought Saif Ali Khan's best moment in the movies till date was the scene in Omkara where he, Langda Tyagi, looks and keeps looking at Ajay Devgn in disbelief when Omkara (Ajay Devgn) makes Kesu (Vivek Oberoi) his political successor; well, stop right there. Saif has outdone his Omkara moment with the aforementioned scene from Rangoon. That alone is worth the price of the ticket.That and the beautiful, almost feral chemistry between the loyal soldier of the British Indian Army, Nawab Malik (Shahid Kapoor), and '40s queen of the Indian big screen Miss Julia (Kangana Ranaut).ALSO SEE: Before Rangoon's Julia, meet the original 'Hunterwali'Rangoon is a triangular love story between Nawab, Julia and Rusi. The story begins in 1943 in India when the British Army requests Rusi Bilmoria to send his beloved, Miss Julia, to the Indo-Burma border so that she can entertain the nation's soldiers. Rusi, a nation-lover, does his duty and sends off Julia with his troupe plus Nawab Malik as Julia's personal security. When the Japanese bomb them on their way, Malik and Julia manage to escape into Burma and, well, love blooms.Vishal Bhardwaj's most expensive and, of late, his most accessible film Rangoon sails smoothly as long its hero and heroine are allowed to just be. Malik and Julia's romance is slow-cooked and the essence of every moment between the two is allowed to linger before the next moment starts. It feels like Nawab Malik and Julia are floating in their own dreamland, perfectly content with the scheme of things, and consequently, Rangoon appears to feel content with itself, devoid of any duties to formal narrative storytelling. There is no rush to fast-forward to the next plot device in this entire stretch where Malik and Julia's romance is built up.Watch Yeh Ishq Hai from Rangoon here:Therefore, in the second half, when Vishal Bhardwaj and Co. pull up their socks to tie all the loose ends and ensure that all three protagonists - Malik, Julia and Rusi - find poetic justice, regardless of how laborious that pursuit might look on screen, Rangoon slowly, slowly bends and breaks its back under the pressure of Vishal Bhardwaj's narrative ambitions.ALSO SEE: Will Rangoon prove to be another Queen for Kangana Ranaut?Rangoon is gorgeous-looking with great cinematography (Pankaj Kumar, take a bow), fantastic sound design and marvellous choreography (Farah Khan, Sudesh Adhana). Love-making in the mud has never looked (and probably, never will) this sexy in a mainstream Hindi film. All that is fine. Where Rangoon does a bloody fail is its attempt to see through its two parallel narrative strands finding a common end: one, the love story, and the other, the war-conspiracy backdrop with the British Indian Army and Subhas Chandra Bose's INA mixed up.Vishal Bhardwaj, caught with the duty to serve two movies in one (an old-school romance and a war thriller), doesn't really do a Casablanca though he does give Rangoon his best shot. Nevertheless, Rangoon comes off as probably 2017's most good-looking and well-made Indian film. Certainly, this year's most ambitious, with three great lead performances. Vishal Bhardwaj is in fine form, mostly. And yes, the National Anthem comes thrice in the film. What more do you want?(The writer tweets as @devarsighosh.)ALSO READ: You cannot copyright a character, say Rangoon makers regarding legal battle

Aamir Khan, whose last film Dangal told the story of two girls who grow up to become formidable wrestlers, says his upcoming movie Secret Superstar -- a musical drama -- is yet another film on the empowerment of the girl child.The film revolves around a teenager who dreams of becoming a famous singer.?Both Dangal and this film are based on the same topic... That we look differently at our daughters. And probably we aren?t able to give the same treatment to our daughters as our sons. So, Secret Superstar is another film based on empowerment of the girl child,? Aamir said here when asked about the message that Secret Superstar carries for the society.The actor was present at the trailer launch of the film on Wednesday.Aamir, a father of three, feels the Indian film industry must make more films for children.?We should make more films for children. This film (Secret Superstar is for youngsters, but isn?t restricted to an age group. This is a family film... It has a wider scope. When our kids were younger, we used to show them foreign animated films which are only for kids. And that is definitely something we should do.?We don?t make enough films for kids in India,? Aamir said.Asked about the recent controversy surrounding children?s reality shows, ignited by filmmaker Amole Gupte, and spurred on by director Shoojit Sircar, Aamir weighed in.?Honestly, I haven?t seen those reality shows. But it cuts both ways (referring to kids getting platform to show their talent and they shouldn?t be overexposed). There are kids who are talented and want to be out there to show their talent, it gives them an opportunity. At the same time, we shouldn?t get so aggressive about it that we really rob them of their childhood,? Aamir said.After portraying the character of Mahavir Singh Phogat in Dangal, Aamir will be seen in a very unusual avatar in Secret Superstar. He says he and his wife Kiran Rao were both very apprehensive about him taking up the role he plays.?When I heard the story for the first time, I loved it a lot. But Advait (director Advait Chandan) asked me to play Shakti Kumar?s character. I told him I couldn?t see myself in that role. Kiran also didn?t want me to do this role.?So, I decided to go through the screen test process. Then while doing the screen test, I had fun and this was a very unusual character, completely opposite of me. So it proved to be a challenge for me as an actor to make the audience believe in the character.?Kiran, who has co-producer the film, also spoke about not wanting Aamir to play the role.?I told him not to do this role as (I felt) he won?t be able to do it. It?s kind of a creepy character... He is a kind of guy who you really don?t want to hang out with alone in a room. So I told him, ?Please don?t do this role as it will be very weird to do such a character after a film like Dangal?.?But when we went through the screen test, we laughed so much that we were convinced he can do this role too. But he wasn?t the original fit.?When asked about the 100% success rate of his films on the box office and his secret for it, Aamir said: ?We just make films we believe in. I am just very fortunate with the films that we have made, the writers and directors that we work with and the talented people that come to us with the films that they want to make.?Somehow it all works out well in the end. I don?t know if it?s anything else to it other than the fact that we believe in what we make and we work with people who are very talented.?Secret Superstar also features Zaira Wasim along with Meher Vij. The film will release in October.Follow @htshowbiz for more

More than half of the languages spoken by India's 1.3 billion people may die out over the next 50 years, scholars said on Thursday, calling for a concerted effort to preserve the tongues spoken by the nation's endangered tribal communities.The People's Linguistic Survey of India (PSLI) raised the alarm during the launch of the latest 11 volumes in its planned 50 volume survey of the country's languages. India's people speak as many as 780 different languages, the PSLI said."At least 400 Indian languages are at the risk of dying in coming 50 years," GN Devy, the chairman of PSLI, said.Each time a language is lost, the corresponding culture is killed, Devy said, adding that India had already lost 250 languages in last five decades.The group of scholars and teachers at PSLI documents Indian regional languages in order to conserve cultural heritage and diversity.Most at risk are marginal tribal communities whose children receive no education or, if they do go to school, are taught in one of India's 22 officially recognised languages."Maithili, which is spoken in the eastern state of Bihar, is at least 1,000 years old. Similarly there are several old languages which are surviving somehow in India, but we are hardly passing them on," said political psychologist Ashis Nandy.Devy said the PSLI will start work on a project to document about 6,000 living languages spoken around the world. The report is scheduled to come out by 2025.ALSO READ:Know interesting facts about Hindi the official language of IndiaBengaluru: Pro-Kannada group demands removal of Hindi boards, threatens to blacken them
